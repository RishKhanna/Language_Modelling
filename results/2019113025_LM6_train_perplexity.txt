  Title: Ulysses  Author: James Joyce  Release Date: December 27, 2001 [eBook #4300] [Most recently updated: December 27, 2019]  Language: English  Character set encoding: UTF-8  Produced by: Col Choat and David Widger  *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ULYSSES ***  [Illustration]     Ulysses   by James Joyce   Contents   — I —   [ 1 ]  [ 2 ]  [ 3 ]   — II —   [ 4 ]  [ 5 ]  [ 6 ]  [ 7 ]  [ 8 ]  [ 9 ]  [ 10 ]  [ 11 ]  [ 12 ]  [ 13 ]  [ 14 ]  [ 15 ]   — III —   [ 16 ]  [ 17 ]  [ 18 ]     — I —   [ 1 ]  Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed	inf
 A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air	5.7237542103015494e+17
  Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:  —Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!  Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest	3.3089487648193003e+38
 He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains	1.5261637364453827e+19
 Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head	2.061985112864257e+30
 Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak	1.2499486749148982e+49
  Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly	2513755634904898.0
  He added in a preacher’s tone:  —For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns	9.504045542757438e+29
 Slow music, please	170543.93528753665
 One moment	1524.6999261294327
 A little trouble about those white corpuscles	256446430.24539793
 Silence, all	19305.682539179437
 Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm	1483646011.333717
 Switch off the current, will you?  He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown	2.7675861409827817e+32
 A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips	1840314308.2936122
  —The mockery of it! he said gaily	39181899249.15302
 Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck	3.1464862929582878e+44
  —My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls	44164841102079.93
 But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn’t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself	1.0941320036921608e+19
 We must go to Athens	2559936.4764912156
 Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?  He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:  —Will he come? The jejune jesuit!  Ceasing, he began to shave with care	8.932443432466144e+47
  —Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly	37759661713.962494
  —Yes, my love?  —How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?  Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder	8.49079749949123e+29
  —God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly	479191659521.0338
 A ponderous Saxon	14421.347460174378
 God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion	5133162144141.508
 O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade	1.1616591226162018e+16
  —He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said	435957161037633.1
 Were you in a funk?  —I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear	1.0515956962521934e+19
 Out here in the dark with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther	6.513747198763592e+22
 You saved men from drowning	1517217.1080941055
 I’m not a hero, however	22474460.909012508
  Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade	21559118523.08632
  He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper pocket, said:  —Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor	2.6203157102016228e+32
  Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief	3.0844310794158707e+19
 Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly	15087776.089359691
 Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:  —The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen	9.095349141610433e+26
  —God! he said quietly	23982114.66427893
 Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother? The snotgreen sea	3.855042764793432e+17
 The scrotumtightening sea	25686.222728565175
 _Epi oinopa ponton_	1512393.6858580597
 Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you	4207658350851.4746
 You must read them in the original	264835012.54033276
 _Thalatta! Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother	26784782199319.79
 Come and look	18271.11397658477
  Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet	30449987057.975147
 Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown	1.035148509606198e+20
 That’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you	30412280743752.297
  —Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily	2315838856.9984956
  —You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said	9.888298227420399e+23
 I’m hyperborean as much as you	26274979.54227446
 But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her	8.388560510013465e+20
 And you refused	17845.206908396074
 There is something sinister in you	22105356.13668501
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
  He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek	193354642033.51517
 A tolerant smile curled his lips	24760677.127079457
  —But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself	297952454247.34076
 Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes	1.701227697585879e+53
 Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him	1.4021844135678386e+22
 The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid	266694478817166.75
 A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting	1.2918789776910921e+32
  Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade	15314038.126465704
  —Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice	43908002937643.68
 I must give you a shirt and a few noserags	468145427040.6275
  —The mockery of it, he said contentedly	68389369429.14946
 Secondleg they should be	228431.6277898474
 I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey	5043110543832.548
 I’m not joking, Kinch	1749919.5815266536
 You look damn well when you’re dressed	159782687.3338736
  —Thanks, Stephen said	2545999.595233686
  Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes	6.867294919776751e+18
 p	139.01694135370747
 i	162.75054454003282
 His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth	242121506425084.9
 Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk	191612523.05466962
  —Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!  Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack	1.3973042411683978e+32
 It asks me too	167432.1599616453
  —I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said	1105102351476086.9
 It does her all right	2016740.6929833675
 Lead him not into temptation	2239774.985636316
 And her name is Ursula	3113563.8659945466
  —The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said	1.1120634704376865e+18
  Parried again	2032.8371160851
 The cold steel pen	154116.00558006015
  —Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea	8.22558152071904e+21
 He’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman	226458215581.8678
 His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other	4.910393885343629e+18
 God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island	6.482863401143932e+20
  Cranly’s arm	1243.6298286297024
 Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe	1.2134946270821705e+44
  Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms	28042118727.00793
 Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another	35042467199302.812
 A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade	206434968.92540857
 I don’t want to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!  Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle	3.4566805764116226e+28
  To ourselves	1542.552351267999
	13.951045332398436
 new paganism	1959.5538431668713
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
  —Let him stay, Stephen said	278722585.06133735
 What have you against me now?  They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale	1.8496427658416388e+32
 Stephen freed his arm quietly	2285990.5819603577
  —Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered	402838078689.26544
 Why? What happened in the name of God?  —You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water	1.8420300264060612e+31
 Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom	417768224962.66254
 She asked you who was in your room	2691566039.102989
 What did I say? I forget	247502610.286737
_  A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan’s cheek	3.570227069753535e+17
  —Did I say that? he asked	3332446752.662081
  —And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You saw only your mother die	8.741131270825347e+24
 I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom	7.651017369831706e+21
 You wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you	3.543517327148465e+17
 To me it’s all a mockery and beastly	2589080025.685117
 Her cerebral lobes are not functioning	31304383.231207576
 You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette’s	1.090894659899113e+25
 Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:  —I am not thinking of the offence to my mother	3.00069645252167e+32
  —Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked	2933260785.471234
  —Of the offence to me, Stephen answered	43822859793.1214
  —O, an impossible person! he exclaimed	38486649041.35979
 Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland	3388987261131045.5
 Sea and headland now grew dim	13927224.178567335
  A voice within the tower called loudly:  —Are you up there, Mulligan?  —I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered	1.0258422264708141e+25
  He turned towards Stephen and said:  —Look at the sea	49105369433379.695
 The Sassenach wants his morning rashers	26403924.20738402
  Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed	3.140731796021872e+16
 Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet	5.493979243511569e+16
 White breast of the dim sea	19531985.49540804
 The twining stresses, two by two	367103504.5069916
 A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords	505488795660.8572
 It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters	272719140821.9385
 Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside	238495016495.36432
 For those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery	21471878368.777214
  Where now?  Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer	5.485266518618566e+27
 A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl	7.171529321735809e+16
 She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:       I am the boy      That can enjoy      Invisibility	2.838854889997772e+30
  Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed	359966131.71561384
       And no more turn aside and brood	201360388.16235444
 Memories beset his brooding brain	2582157.3610201213
 Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament	3338222640888357.0
 A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening	1.0830175910891226e+22
 On me alone	16733.285955291853
 Ghostly light on the tortured face	26857733.046239097
 Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees	2163455663043285.0
 _Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat	256478831569470.03
  —Kinch ahoy!  Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower	29707767056869.438
  —Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey	408236705534.46857
 Breakfast is ready	13758.137246100114
 Haines is apologising for waking us last night	2516220468.865342
 It’s all right	15787.975423736121
  —I’m coming, Stephen said, turning	3335589706.014181
 For my sake and for all our sakes	3502868140.223283
  —I told him your symbol of Irish art	24985403514.56458
 He says it’s very clever	1725084.8551086204
 Touch him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean	6272356767336193.0
  —I get paid this morning, Stephen said	31386217645.008427
  —The school kip? Buck Mulligan said	2579325239.610076
 How much? Four quid? Lend us one	17802566745.64833
  —If you want it, Stephen said	3693036294.684372
  —Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight	195947340405.95453
 We’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids	656649585872.5109
 Four omnipotent sovereigns	16926.231760239196
  He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent:       O, won’t we have a merry time,      Drinking whisky, beer and wine!      On coronation,      Coronation day!      O, won’t we have a merry time      On coronation day!  Warm sunshine merrying over the sea	1.465521917670677e+64
 A servant too	16598.431796410445
 A server of a servant	2131165.190918646
  In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow	9.293616236090533e+28
 Haines, open that door, will you?  Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker	1.0347439842540758e+18
 A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors	1.072906634578658e+25
  —Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said	3142207969.6583323
 Janey Mack, I’m choked!  He howled, without looking up from the fire:  —Kinch!  —It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward	3.995786596170155e+32
  The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered	6.343648793043758e+24
 Haines stood at the doorway, looking out	2674722755.8835373
 Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait	729232347784620.2
 Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him	4538994090389.932
 Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief	7.179505486975272e+23
  —I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when	67401050486360.42
	13.951045332398436
 Haines, come in	229478.6277475143
 Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts	403240802133.07153
  Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker	1.2747448992155923e+17
 Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet	2940839391.2477846
  —What sort of a kip is this? he said	4250688498822.0938
  —We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily	469334105592.4268
 I want Sandycove milk	224866.76246738643
  Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:  —That woman is coming up with the milk	9.366003080052874e+20
  —The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair	5.915028405468893e+18
 Sit down	1428.3481452120325
 The sugar is in the bag	29935820.726101317
_  Haines sat down to pour out the tea	26987356181.410088
 And when I makes water I makes water	2320477935.335361
  —By Jove, it is tea, Haines said	422034923683.0652
  Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:  —_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she	1.367049076290876e+22
 _Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don’t make them in the one pot	1.034277416700757e+23
  —That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines	5134054978499138.0
 Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind	39099073072991.016
  He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows:  —Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?  —I doubt it, said Stephen gravely	1.7785711247801933e+53
 Your reasons, pray?  —I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion	2.3281277449799123e+27
  Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight	13791071.007447632
 Do you think she was? Quite charming!  Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:  _—For old Mary Ann  She doesn’t care a damn	1.6711306076915747e+47
  But, hising up her petticoats	30521154.612919968
	13.951045332398436
  The doorway was darkened by an entering form	1874638590.4408727
  —The milk, sir!  —Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said	8907824967545624.0
  An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow	190518496200.7615
  —That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said	460093167184.33594
 Glory be to God	174792.90051615145
 Ah, to be sure!  Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker	8.25986540902776e+17
  —How much, sir? asked the old woman	394122625194.36816
 Old shrunken paps	12388.772365560208
 Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger	3793452183576029.5
 They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle	446314854717.9391
 Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times	4.394144126262421e+16
 A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning	4.3963904431413296e+29
 To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour	8.728156827441529e+19
  —It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups	4.824380401230943e+17
  He drank at her bidding	1724510.045094526
  —If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts	1.0406768996628737e+32
 Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits	1.8540022185978025e+22
  —Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked	516789712034777.25
  —Look at that now, she said	3659625234.880041
  Stephen listened in scornful silence	2229901.7980613476
 And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes	3.2400522275820332e+16
  —Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her	3758472839916.542
  Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently	361467202118.0834
 Are you from the west, sir?  —I am an Englishman, Haines answered	6.396850033944791e+17
  —He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland	6.330945478349331e+19
  —Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the language myself	9.279174859426629e+21
  —Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan	4140654635693.8125
 Fill us out some more tea, Kinch	1911930988.9614344
  —Bill, sir? she said, halting	53940590602.24424
 Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling	9.312268218413847e+33
 That’s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir	598988040580481.8
  Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets	1.1582018014345873e+31
  —Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling	501957386750063.06
  Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk	2.6715113239971658e+17
 Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried:  —A miracle!  He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:  —Ask nothing more of me, sweet	5.682669488304112e+43
 All I can give you I give	260358735.61906418
  Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand	3411798023.9696465
  —We’ll owe twopence, he said	235162400.88762283
  —Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin	58895604857684.68
_  He turned to Stephen and said:  —Seriously, Dedalus	58815734008614.88
 I’m stony	1313.3888732993132
 Today the bards must drink and junket	282673968.17208517
  —Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said	2507995718.954006
  Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:  —I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me	4.666806970100277e+38
  Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone:  —Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines	7.318802701204077e+26
  —Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen	7086784439999480.0
 The problem is to get money	36479022.159980156
 From whom? From the milkwoman or from him	44507354271.20624
  Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm	2973074033156.3125
  In a suddenly changed tone he added:  —To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right	5.342543968874884e+20
 Let us get out of the kip	245669976.48699915
  He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly:  —Mulligan is stripped of his garments	1.47710136791891e+25
  He emptied his pockets on to the table	4511441643.82004
  And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain	1.0324498273778395e+24
 I want puce gloves and green boots	168598474.20104715
 Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself	26002312565107.312
  —And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said	321799476906.1738
  Stephen picked it up and put it on	2802660156.3142886
 Haines called to them from the doorway:  —Are you coming, you fellows?  —I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door	1.8877923642049165e+30
 Come out, Kinch	198962.76799696026
 You have eaten all we left, I suppose	28453834478.252415
 Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:  —And going forth he met Butterly	1.970778424109293e+25
  Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it	2.744473004529373e+32
 He put the huge key in his inner pocket	24174153801.120476
  At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:  —Did you bring the key?  —I have it, Stephen said, preceding them	3.727932886066112e+29
 Martello you call it?  —Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea	2.078955359211613e+25
 But ours is the _omphalos_	283542293.51326466
  —What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen	3193724725893.3096
  —No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain	378205122630.6554
 Wait till I have a few pints in me first	264832933410.00394
  —You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably	34727432188.03212
 We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes	1940753266.9829855
 He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father	1.079396556706628e+23
  —What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen	3781152242042.44
 He himself?  Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:  —O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!  —We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines	2.812924653361575e+55
 And it is rather long to tell	277137058.02019393
  —The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said	7293599143341134.0
  —I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore	1.4505424995903945e+27
 _That beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?  Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak	7.770595870410911e+28
 In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires	3.191015458151753e+19
  —It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again	3934835598644079.0
 The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins	4.557751581607837e+34
  —I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused	972861720868578.6
  Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face	2848163854991.723
 He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety	1.668102041825139e+30
 With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree	166773887.51522788
 So here’s to disciples and Calvary	39248832.10760953
_  He held up a forefinger of warning	2692293258.7948847
  _—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again	1.4034485759852632e+40
_  He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:  _—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead	9.322378979091585e+70
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
  Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said:  —We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose	1.4080057703227459e+25
 He’s rather blasphemous	18850.72863902943
 Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?  —The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered	1.913268169815588e+35
  —O, Haines said, you have heard it before?  —Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily	1.5600673334591254e+26
 I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word	119989585133090.95
 Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God	33768665713.329052
  —There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said	8.503659857234554e+17
  Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone	2.5224226610830572e+16
 He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it	280185170932.4777
  Haines helped himself and snapped the case to	2203876508.931385
  —Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again	9301446875610250.0
 Either you believe or you don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal God	7.453931386048448e+21
 My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path	1.0379849825096663e+18
 They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark	45476751001191.71
 He wants that key	172609.37225071498
 It is mine	18047.900994321026
 Give him the key too	2076756.8636072462
 All	153.28185490596655
 He will ask for it	2241352.419258483
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
  —After all, I should think you are able to free yourself	372864606053479.6
 You are your own master, it seems to me	345862147407.5794
  —Italian? Haines said	1925248.1966784208
 Kneel down before me	152202.09631605205
  —And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs	1.0157078499636287e+18
  —Italian? Haines said again	20162606.93651825
  —I can quite understand that, he said calmly	336218346142.5435
 We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly	3004778116040.5312
 It seems history is to blame	18657350.20254264
  The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars	1.2132405678826961e+47
 Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger	27363183241939.195
 Idle mockery	1190.2904789588194
  Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman	6.332645260508356e+16
 It’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one	442005529733935.8
 It’s nine days today	130327.87222593099
 Here I am	17104.025539749615
  They followed the winding path down to the creek	38747575868.045364
 Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder	9.686307595194882e+18
 A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water	1.8780187580055263e+27
  —Is the brother with you, Malachi?  —Down in Westmeath	987710348967864.5
 With the Bannons	29045.7951334986
  —Still there? I got a card from Bannon	294726114589.9094
 Says he found a sweet young thing down there	24994889098.812984
 Photo girl he calls her	1631634.8297787544
  —Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure	183863812.11068738
  Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots	2876285129.5162625
  —Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock	1.353371834662673e+19
 Chucked medicine and going in for the army	2289560626.8050957
 You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?  —Yes	2985794035650.7207
 The father is rotto with money	34407358.95340754
  —Is she up the pole?  —Better ask Seymour that	39947108806021.5
  He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt	274339868062292.66
  —My twelfth rib is gone, he cried	39569988190.77627
 I’m the _Übermensch	211450.77917550365
  —Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked	329025025430.347
  —Later on, Haines said	25810172.2285328
 Not on my breakfast	171769.57462142158
  Stephen turned away	14902.59298248716
  —I’m going, Mulligan, he said	4034406502.459042
  Stephen handed him the key	1959161.0318242868
  Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap	1891817993.5009646
 Dressing, undressing	23462.962790220237
 Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:  —He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord	9.256418396559801e+25
 Thus spake Zarathustra	10333.66324678381
  Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon	5713801865278891.0
  —The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried	286076494.85475355
 Half twelve	1321.5160015569627
  —Good, Stephen said	2686392.321793674
  He walked along the upwardcurving path	27482108.77306988
       Liliata rutilantium	1174.6057774896478
      Iubilantium te virginum	10604.397201861084
  The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly	4803123165821.241
 I will not sleep here tonight	17835679.744546328
 It called again	17010.64614053118
  Usurper	193.68270965874825
     [ 2 ]   —You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?  —Tarentum, sir	8.123554427543968e+19
 Well?  —There was a battle, sir	36077189181.21365
  —Very good	17543.20146662645
  Fabled by the daughters of memory	19731911.877167083
 And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it	350124236152946.4
 What’s left us then?  —I forget the place, sir	43138459264573.0
 279 B	1869.8862822199014
  —Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book	1.585803314258098e+18
  —Yes, sir	239799.14518262498
_  That phrase the world had remembered	239521106.105987
 A dull ease of the mind	23840553.70451574
 From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear	5.0677872001357775e+19
 Any general to any officers	1514251.9646538717
 They lend ear	13307.510117685331
  —You, Armstrong, Stephen said	359217472.6045245
 What was the end of Pyrrhus?  —End of Pyrrhus, sir?  —I know, sir	1.1077516029708542e+21
 Ask me, sir, Comyn said	270629796.2382308
 He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly	18656533230853.934
 Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips	5437295480.766879
 A sweetened boy’s breath	142003.32520920565
  All laughed	1487.5284841434395
 Mirthless high malicious laughter	171774.29251709773
 In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay	1.4106747909506556e+24
  —Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book, what is a pier	1.1639544163854918e+22
  —A pier, sir, Armstrong said	3412335336.112492
 A kind of a bridge	2503118.9155699383
 Kingstown pier, sir	158732.9284233346
  Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning	1815485081.206028
 Two in the back bench whispered	20619988.744338486
 Yes	148.1683564919063
 All	153.28185490596655
 Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle	1.2815815622502644e+22
  —Kingstown pier, Stephen said	21686315.118501548
 Yes, a disappointed bridge	3270606.361313425
  The words troubled their gaze	1768369.4954109215
 A bridge is across a river	21787012.076577697
  For Haines’s chapbook	20095.59114897083
 No-one here to hear	169438.98263574557
 Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind	2.8536252243982845e+17
 What then? A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master’s praise	2.1510064781086994e+23
 For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop	6.053457035961691e+19
  Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death	1.6452244507727348e+20
 They are not to be thought away	229828771.45515618
 Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted	1.315676210806036e+21
 But can those have been possible seeing that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave, weaver of the wind	1.2902532836163163e+30
  —Tell us a story, sir	283476162.3929489
  —O, do, sir	32945940.36327628
 A ghoststory	1560.1446613700846
  —Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book	3883136720801104.5
  —_Weep no more,_ Comyn said	33362445413.07191
  —Go on then, Talbot	25390344.59684713
  —And the story, sir?  —After, Stephen said	78957288770197.9
  A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel	8.076716935481892e+17
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
_  It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible	8.190875875913002e+16
 Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night	3.4921333125191926e+38
 Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds	1.713604951803941e+42
 Thought is the thought of thought	26015992.61556173
 Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms	341518693372.8399
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
_  —Turn over, Stephen said quietly	3225813531.029981
 I don’t see anything	168769.2625749166
  —What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward	3099986807644.4277
  His hand turned the page over	23071145.238153104
 Of him that walked the waves	27200117.87880589
 Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine	9.163036216465583e+20
 It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute	2618055222601163.0
 A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church’s looms	1.6783761960599885e+21
 Ay	136.53378529935392
       Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro	3034989387.9649086
      My father gave me seeds to sow	163223763.6745947
  Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel	1491410538.1600983
  —Have I heard all? Stephen asked	2960602123.50646
  —Half day, sir	2264742.882454566
  —Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked	25329988091.991043
  They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling	3950641819877.8345
  —O, ask me, sir	333531561.2823093
  —A hard one, sir	30370527.517104223
  What is that?  —What, sir?  —Again, sir	788167273938883.6
 After a silence Cochrane said:  —What is it, sir? We give it up	7.57910989495603e+18
  He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay	4.419142808298939e+17
  A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:  —Hockey!  They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them	1.876512194683818e+30
 Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues	1.3334724936553124e+22
 The word _Sums_ was written on the headline	862070716670.3474
 Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot	2.8956632527488727e+18
 Cyril Sargent: his name and seal	279938691.1648938
  —Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir	1.6948601915809766e+24
  Stephen touched the edges of the book	270958121.1483006
 Futility	193.68270965874825
  —Do you understand how to do them now? he asked	38805986288199.99
  —Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered	2005133044.2664526
 Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir	450086555852448.06
  —Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked	27183806123.42141
  —No, sir	246725.9179753568
  Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail’s bed	8.477040219199088e+19
 A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped	1.483044914101797e+49
 Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend	9.28235923281206e+42
  In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data	3279184267.0098934
 Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin	6.129751561771882e+26
  Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness	4864082659486.506
 My childhood bends beside me	1365115.2124116307
 Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly	31295770438236.89
 Mine is far and his secret as our eyes	25103902475.35288
  —It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up	45802340682826.98
  —Yes, sir	239799.14518262498
  —Yes, sir	239799.14518262498
  In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield	74635077405111.06
  —Sargent!  —Run on, Stephen said	34933420193.24031
 Mr Deasy is calling you	1863856.3346266558
 When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him	57198259136939.7
  —What is it now? he cried continually without listening	4504911507387.676
  —Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said	5649412439297474.0
  —Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here	7.54978507631679e+21
  Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs	5.664659695283592e+18
 As on the first day he bargained with me here	332126944500.88605
 As it was in the beginning, is now	46930855583.17768
  A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor	3339640399465.278
 Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table	2085846057037.7478
  —First, our little financial settlement, he said	798955369478.5242
 Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James	3.655293178169902e+42
  A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth	9.90519662498633e+16
 See	146.02148281804753
 This is for shillings	191582.46584960463
 Sixpences, halfcrowns	22895.845254619264
  He shot from it two crowns and two shillings	24127234735.029602
 I think you’ll find that’s right	15625449.236164352
 You have earned it	279720.5650988059
  Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells	35627840079294.94
 Symbols too of beauty and of power	235751361.47645915
 A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery	21927852233939.23
  —Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said	353917372119.9825
  Answer something	1379.2293421807087
 Three times now	14328.723491628723
 Three nooses round me here	2243899.9748060396
 Well? I can break them in this instant if I will	30432707085083.56
  —Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger	418298177289496.2
 You don’t know yet what money is	213215841.64279187
 When you have lived as long as I have	26196800201.4969
 If youth but knew	149933.3019989606
 But what does Shakespeare say? _Put but money in thy purse	271024553591424.25
 He made money	16675.921070645003
  —That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets	598709584982186.9
  —Ba! Mr Deasy cried	18388084.80053195
 He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail	263090270.5325761
 _I paid my way	2055052.5320195912
_  Good man, good man	27186748.71910334
_ Can you feel that? _I owe nothing	347115841373.47943
_ Can you?  Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties	5.770092898474354e+20
 McCann, one guinea	262497.42940276477
 Temple, two lunches	240429.6523070067
 Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks’ board	5.019262161316363e+31
 The lump I have is useless	22918660.672800094
  —For the moment, no, Stephen answered	48775400230.71057
 But one day you must feel it	237751631.5036117
 We are a generous people but we must also be just	2407660361735.1133
  —I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy	4.399324092818902e+16
  Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales	1.0165957918141107e+29
 I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time	210599240.9097715
 I remember the famine in ’46	502965012.75001425
 Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things	5.7330408558638375e+38
  Glorious, pious and immortal memory	17001228.605565377
 The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes	885685089805740.1
 The black north and true blue bible	191912153.0688126
  —I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said	40275980159915.95
 On the spindle side	187396.6172277988
 But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union	365794856722386.56
  —_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto	1.5469000227877213e+17
  A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots	5022509281.7838745
 Day!	1570.6804698336498
 Day!	1570.6804698336498

 Lal the ral the ra	1839164.466084126
 Lal the ral the raddy	2788825.2469741073
  —That reminds me, Mr Deasy said	2943856676.240079
 I have a letter here for the press	3192411352.0168324
 Sit down a moment	174624.6053271428
  He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter	1.6344373043965845e+30
  —Sit down	16943.490205136568
  He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error	8.183961722371991e+42
  Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence	2207606280.9495587
 Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster’s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort’s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, 1866	7.561224392381712e+51
 Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign	47371205241.959145
_  Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush	4.315560370145212e+38
 Even money _Fair Rebel	1468189.3645247843
_ Ten to one the field	27664846.873292983
  Again: a goal	187826.0554880935
 You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick? Jousts	3989635943532311.0
 Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock	211531673.86407456
 Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts	4.3016315706908974e+26
  —Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising	36689586496.41293
  —I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said	744660473166925.9
 It’s about the foot and mouth disease	223668371.07115763
 There can be no two opinions on the matter	25596988114.74997
  May I trespass on your valuable space	354841292.60408574
 That doctrine of _laissez faire_ which so often in our history	423069121075973.44
 The way of all our old industries	380156592.19507825
 European conflagration	1748.7198093567029

 To come to the point at issue	263862448.2516556
  Foot and mouth disease	155437.88885851228

 Mr Henry Blackwood Price	127218.91213631071
 Dictates of common sense	132702.06886259146
 In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns	42520637467534.16
 Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns	2318757969.2375064
  —I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said	537440895780789.4
 You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle	4.317453185089894e+16
 And it can be cured	2046385.1784559635
 It is cured	17096.60411161915
 My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there	1.2579766182330331e+22
 They offer to come over here	19728638.277214963
 I am trying to work up influence with the department	252348901724.00888
 Now I’m going to try publicity	16173722.485394241
 I am surrounded by difficulties, by	320746236.53142166
	13.951045332398436
 intrigues by	2107.05048388705

	13.951045332398436
 backstairs influence by	19704.52519972184
  He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke	423161657717203.06
 England is in the hands of the jews	3565373885.7674704
 And they are the signs of a nation’s decay	45820239550.49891
 I have seen it coming these years	195795566.58790576
  He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam	3.665960063323422e+18
       The harlot’s cry from street to street      Shall weave old England’s windingsheet	62182374088593.44
  His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted	2.5102428451041376e+16
 And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day	717015502464774.8
 Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures	2451676391313.9956
 Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain	3.3835607592814165e+29
 Vain patience to heap and hoard	14215264.565797511
 Time surely would scatter all	1381244.663848483
 A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on	4060940657549.8438
 Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh	8.132279848747055e+18
  —Who has not? Stephen said	268512707.1356938
  —What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked	27495870165.255642
  He came forward a pace and stood by the table	333539811885.1871
 Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me	2979727002954.523
  —History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake	5.902698984813076e+17
 What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?  —The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said	9.726322428536508e+25
 All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God	374811760307939.7
  Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:  —That is God	4475663223211135.5
  —A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders	894836336045588.8
 Looking up again he set them free	187471423.2764196
 A woman brought sin into the world	240880727.94614154
 For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy	1.0513641560627506e+30
 A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman, O’Rourke, prince of Breffni	1.936951056069749e+25
 A woman too brought Parnell low	17015808.94330197
 Many errors, many failures but not the one sin	389564947415.4542
 But I will fight for the right till the end	352229274258.40576
       For Ulster will fight      And Ulster will be right	18391855063.556866
  —Well, sir, he began	357627772.1154635
  —I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work	6.257543933104154e+20
 You were not born to be a teacher, I think	6060808816674.693
 Perhaps I am wrong	157495.13297644965
  —A learner rather, Stephen said	430891466.88311976
  And here what will you learn more?  Mr Deasy shook his head	320540944757005.75
  —Who knows? he said	26056412.646369893
 To learn one must be humble	17668205.73535335
  Stephen rustled the sheets again	1712694.485362353
  —As regards these, he began	241437602.66430455
  —Yes, Mr Deasy said	27756357.535619956
 You have two copies there	1777514.090558849
_  —I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow	7175021114114930.0
 I know two editors slightly	2267282.374381838
  —That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly	31402117665.061718
P	139.01694135370747
 There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the City Arms hotel	7.813371761710832e+16
	13.951045332398436
 There is no time to lose	22030554.475722782
  —Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket	7.572442653976277e+16
  —Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk	6.000915396575927e+17
  —Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back	6.47812402300645e+16
 The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors	5.3082454510205766e+17
 Still I will help him in his fight	2437336580.8387494
  —Mr Dedalus!  Running after me	227050930.0832755
 No more letters, I hope	22532448.75188508
  —Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate	672467564591228.1
  Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath	337675444900.12695
 Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews	6.960391824545382e+19
 Do you know that? No	25342141.91949645
 And do you know why?  He frowned sternly on the bright air	363297421208413.4
  —Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile	4108816447269.2734
  —Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly	36659411986174.86
  A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm	4.0825363153820506e+17
  —She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path	2.5232608642682773e+27
  On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins	6.794396211477073e+17
     [ 3 ]   Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes	3.5651156624006033e+21
 Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot	2.1708940852631644e+23

 Limits of the diaphane	182724.5591777596
 But he adds: in bodies	20689745.51935822
 How? By knocking his sconce against them, sure	364183101255.1364
 Bald he was and a millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_	1.5938011885775516e+16
 Limit of the diaphane in	2186268.1571416687
 Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane	31287388.15146122
 Shut your eyes and see	1891629.4115061497
 You are walking through it howsomever	27404851.31383636
 A very short space of time through very short times of space	22985839951911.902
 Five, six: the _nacheinander_	5487121751.855681
 Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible	6035413365081.129
 No	152.29096525086916
 Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o’er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark	9.915518106792036e+31

 They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out	1.58054433319025e+25
 His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop	5.139968362389228e+16
 He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell	8.820352728629156e+32
 Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody’s body	256978527054.35318
  —Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!  The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight	7.193900871020583e+38
 He slunk back in a curve	31909478.911823824
 Doesn’t see me	15269.490367724646
 Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it	2.6077907497951494e+26
 The simple pleasures of the poor	25365837.85446541
 His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved	1318905371543436.5

 That’s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter	2037543713918.2463
  His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending	3191012314604.6123
 Me sits there with his augur’s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars	2.5282734116725035e+35
 Endless, would it be mine, form of my form? Who watches me here? Who ever anywhere will read these written words? Signs on a white field	1.1257086227339051e+33

 I am caught in this burning scene	172129231.27984464
 Pain is far	15282.610534675328

 Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks	6255040328469.687
 In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels	7.355052987498852e+17
 And, spent, its speech ceases	234975672.9270429
 It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling	65488166232305.77
 Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall	5174428527909434.0

 No, I didn’t	231043.98283647996

 For the rest let look who will	243909732.24587023
  Behind	141.1101173562327
  He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant	629357895128.6125
 Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship	1.2514684305544724e+31
 He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes	3.813379257268867e+25
 Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine	1.118871416076021e+22
  Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray	6.504337691328218e+22
 Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere	3.99928276830294e+17
 Made him feel a bit peckish	26870099.843037043
 Right	142.41958237187993
 He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire	8.199454782231647e+20
 It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out	29032646271118.016
 Cup of tea soon	154339.20940109648
 Mouth dry	1325.7791384816846

 Just how she stalks over my writingtable	244034569.4357891
 Prr	193.68270965874825
  Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form	314996068823.718
 He bent down to her, his hands on his knees	4574016174150.869
  —Milk for the pussens, he said	5801202219.9253025
  —Mrkgnao! the cat cried	32369498.001527864
  They call them stupid	148492.4442416796
 They understand what we say better than we understand them	189265849618.265
 She understands all she wants to	20344952.876006395
 Vindictive too	1334.2037701881727
 Her nature	1531.5046666955054
 Seem to like it	193297.36688940754
 Wonder what I look like to her	254365326.1787804
 Height of a tower? No, she can jump me	3323283668767.2915
  —Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly	343952976.9308548
  She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth	1.2751560616299899e+22
 Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor	6.898561331643178e+33
  —Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap	39799755783.93369
  He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly	6.405045606513527e+19
 Wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after	21846582334515.266
 Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips	78659745178757.3
  He listened to her licking lap	17539746.876329068
 Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz’s	22632278.91127691
 Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him	21802451111.42395
 No	152.29096525086916
 Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning	23729170983.344677
 Still perhaps: once in a way	250389914.16425192
  He said softly in the bare hall:  —I’m going round the corner	4750482774280636.0
  No	152.29096525086916
 She didn’t want anything	152644.00688964906
 He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled	1.0952600363892597e+25
 Must get those settled really	1322114.6921668688
 Bought it at the governor’s auction	27152681.78323622
 Got a short knock	159125.05602674198
 Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy	22117917139.02439
 Yes, sir	20129.8053674826
 I rose from the ranks, sir, and I’m proud of it	960291543206229.2
 Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps	2449988574936.537
 Now that was farseeing	261788.08482394577
 Stamps: stickyback pictures	188330.8095755148

 The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s high grade ha	4.573264324470216e+18

 Must get it	17176.450909745214
 No use disturbing her	224441.67653076645
 She turned over sleepily that time	18146481.322918355
 He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid	1.3328194683818981e+26
 Looked shut	1349.9426591061415
 All right till I come back anyhow	189819361.74075353
  He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive	1.2432463453454034e+16
 The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church	36940627668.06696
 Be a warm day I fancy	20258595.803922176

 Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun	48981287099322.18
 Sunburst on the titlepage	268268.2194652798
 He smiled, pleasing himself	1959927.9572068006
 What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland	2.82448095432735e+32
 He prolonged his pleased smile	2437614.887615641
  He approached Larry O’Rourke’s	123600.2195267858
 From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter	3181889216823.977
 Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush	1.7626031284326275e+17
 Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic	40400940871863.88

 Cute old codger	28403.986580009427
 Do you know what I’m going to tell you? What’s that, Mr O’Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians, they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese	2.4355820564694134e+36

 Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O’Rourke	1960479445.7138002

 The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade	6.387166155050841e+16
 The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood	1.4482664225809414e+27

 Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer	2632436487.735736
  He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias	1.3207227970189967e+24
 Can become ideal winter sanatorium	1481161.2504399763
 He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling	1.0641069639004784e+26
 A young white heifer	158055.0173161127
 Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands	2.4735803070774714e+54
 He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest	7.023153688989357e+21
  The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace	7.329924574108183e+20
 And one shilling threepence change	1572541.0624489565
 For you, please?  Mr Bloom pointed quickly	29358283052.47627

  —Threepence, please	196151.03085808404
  —Thank you, sir	2466030.327483385
  A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him	26109350592.210922
 He withdrew his gaze after an instant	183711613.3239749
  —Good morning, he said, moving away	36883406349.09243

 Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume	1.1632885555640728e+24
 Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume	34380112419.688324
 Always the same, year after year	254151944.5273856
 Must be without a flaw, he said	3032795119.3274517
 Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees	1.8418134548311755e+26

 The oldest people	16892.24332703076
 Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere	4.3834285379399673e+20

 Now it could bear no more	18096629.091084484
  Desolation	193.68270965874825
 Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward	3685776412530841.5
 Well, I am here now	24450780.6857202
 Yes, I am here now	25111762.325940836
 Got up wrong side of the bed	227805198.82989728
 Must begin again those Sandow’s exercises	11603912.815344468
 Blotchy brown brick houses	106689.51055238215
 Why is that? Valuation is only twentyeight	3244582880.7968526
 To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter	6.760790842042726e+16
 Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh	20112354.63749588
 Yes, yes	20654.3608520074
 He stooped and gathered them	1803002.15795547
 His quickened heart slowed at once	34756404.045837395
  —Poldy!  Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head	6.578590380419426e+21
 Mullingar	130.34271098863758
 Milly	133.75343456219844
  —A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you	1.1140674525760061e+19
  He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees	6.161399781360257e+17
  —Do you want the blind up?  Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow	8.191778844527811e+32
  —She got the things, she said	4051303204.351773
  He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh	3.0013371776930705e+19
 I’m parched	1988.767089820975
  —The kettle is boiling, he said	3570364243.3943715
  But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed	1.1688362798667848e+31
  On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout	347598818004027.1
 He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in	5.266524281660432e+28
 While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him	3381564133834.5996
 Give her too much meat she won’t mouse	1575967426.984196
 Say they won’t eat pork	1343500.1925747753
 Here	145.01976844034456
 He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup	7853947425623.702
  Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over	397143409360796.8
 Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s seaside girls	2.380403543216474e+20
 He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling	5037963065717.414
 Silly Milly’s birthday gift	101430.26381156346
 I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke	4926348202.85852
 He smiled, pouring	198680.8072355838
       O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling	33905166565.880203
      You are my lookingglass from night to morning	2210710801.098618
 Dreadful old case	13187.540048281197
 Still he was a courteous old chap	222210616.76260343
 Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform	480990806630.0055
 And the little mirror in his silk hat	3080969518.733083
 O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! All we laughed	3288102396564057.0
 Sex breaking out even then	1366558.7038398196
 Pert little piece she was	2352973.7655274263
  He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray	9.430595112344453e+20
 Its hump bumped as he took it up	2872404912.946335
 Everything on it? Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream	5.832799718961668e+17
 Yes	148.1683564919063
  Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead	1.2991756618092928e+23
  —What a time you were! she said	39209880131.162674
  She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow	4.7667755425042406e+17
 The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured	1.257061258936848e+22
  A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow	1828348540083.2598
 In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread	5547729010143.296
  —Who was the letter from? he asked	39630167690.12237
  —O, Boylan, she said	369990152.99852604
  —What are you singing?  —_Là ci darem_ with J	3750091304019836.5
 Doyle, she said, and _Love’s Old Sweet Song_	46611842002005.125
  Her full lips, drinking, smiled	240982183.1559314
  Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed	5.165570184039888e+19
 No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole	4.668850501558647e+18
  —No: that book	2415881.4279452763
  Other stocking	1317.632360622207
  —It must have fell down, she said	36656293443.61991
 Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_	392983732764.54193
 Must have slid down	151446.60155403352
 He stooped and lifted the valance	33050401.801445354
  —Show here, she said	28384396.96376749
 I put a mark in it	26259140.78161698
  She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word	3.0892074354845583e+38
  —Met him what? he asked	275166855.3952873
  —Here, she said	2842041.4219665457
 What does that mean?  He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail	3423495808205347.0
  —Metempsychosis?  —Yes	2182876.023111733
 Who’s he when he’s at home?  —Metempsychosis, he said, frowning	4674760425292437.0
 It’s Greek: from the Greek	20317763.17318798
  —O, rocks! she said	306447848.73470366
 Tell us in plain words	1714619.6870052232
 The same young eyes	198900.88307918902

	13.951045332398436
  —Did you finish it? he asked	2899492858.535956
 Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?  —Never read it	8.667572770766913e+17
 Do you want another?  —Yes	251252168.8672565
 Get another of Paul de Kock’s	22111412.781789437
 Nice name he has	169947.34744618717
 Reincarnation: that’s the word	1990649.2092379706
  —Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before	1.0285059290555864e+25
 They call it reincarnation	161624.22928600587
 They say we have forgotten it	19904292.007297702
  The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea	46659545055.68664
 Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis	2460700987.3886943

 She said it would look nice over the bed	29308172378.752422
 They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance	3.89209676585234e+18
  —There’s a smell of burn, she said	54641063243.1587
  He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs	3.278376023063347e+37
 Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan	2611359164831104.0
 By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back	1.3755304530489974e+22
 He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it	8.183393665403657e+20
 He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf	40682472288228.08
 He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat	53281324399591.08
 A mouthful of tea	285978.0116945468
 What was that about some young student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth	3.7835738248161135e+43
 I got mummy’s lovely box of creams and am writing	271644723843.6755
 They are lovely	15884.296454778436

 Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street	3.359745130097815e+18
 Jolly old woman	13984.163657930809
 Lot of babies she must have helped into the world	240525035788.41797
 She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn’t live	208385594176.84256
 Well, God is good, sir	313940106.69184995
 He would be eleven now if he had lived	23462224545.47082
  His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript	3836384718.181535
 Hurry	129.25424683377128

 Music hall stage	12151.397304810418
 Young student	1346.3827050703114
 He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal	38467692816536.93
 Then he read the letter again: twice	2738399009.9475083
  O, well: she knows how to mind herself	301755734956.0034
 But if not? No, nothing has happened	26148152248.929398
 Wait in any case till it does	193769461.81979036
 A wild piece of goods	1739270.699382015

 Destiny	127.7885473092705
 Ripening now	1326.7603784327891
  He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window	19973646000.234863
 Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red	3533200443681358.5
 Was given milk too long	1610454.8830997553
 On the _Erin’s King_ that day round the Kish	4001411136846.0034
 Damned old tub pitching about	1840645.7334079172

 Hands stuck in his trousers’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing	4.4335994521641576e+16
 Swurls, he says	213658.41956203934

 Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding	1.195109650093675e+18
  A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing	107717711617246.98
 Useless: can’t move	135004.5482493677
 Girl’s sweet light lips	126626.04897208026

 Lips kissed, kissing, kissed	19573664.65701321
  Better where she is down there: away	2497453629.089034
 Occupy her	2152.9928713690524
 Wanted a dog to pass the time	265090827.40170446
 Might take a trip down there	18166986.728276625

  The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door	2.3983824913833985e+25
 She looked back at him, mewing	230883541.82983878

  Heaviness: hot day coming	2191693.720098225
 Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing	2854613681164.563

 The cat went up in soft bounds	325583907.046811
 Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed	8.290958462708318e+16
  Listening, he heard her voice:  —Come, come, pussy	867632681588329.6
 No sound	1448.1235274528995
 Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry	14874026.022155115
  He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall	4112842625227150.5
 Scarlet runners	1830.8646978944544
 Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil	347365763200.99725

 Picking up the letters	176039.96710897068
 Queer I was just thinking that moment	195292892.98696968

 He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel	5292217348262.402
 Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows	241830972815571.12
 The king was in his countinghouse	39096195.47042631

  Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second	1.8018585600409972e+21
 Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone	9.210535076344555e+30

 Life might be so	167791.3307600409
 It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat	3245958451655924.5
 He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell	2222839526492.0615
 Neat certainly	1252.1531764536796

 Why? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing	2937231817306199.5
 No use humming then	143439.08990399438
 Strange kind of music that last night	193009446.31093323
 The mirror was in shadow	2298749.0640330585
 She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub	3044456615848357.5
 Peering into it	15495.979481134043
 It wouldn’t pan out somehow	1407350.2588426936
  Evening hours, girls in grey gauze	266920237.89465114
 Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks	30255414253.67545
 Still, true to life also	22355775.21848228
 Day: then the night	2379754.9510813435
 Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself	6178319956234.088
 He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air	1.3490057417845614e+21
  In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees	9.867211229444206e+31

 While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair	7.595496088703398e+29
 Very warm morning	13887.408774579815
 Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha	2.45912838741943e+20
 Just there	1551.3067025250548
 His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair	269472128176698.94
 Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands	1.0776048942435184e+25

 As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg	2.2096306326837852e+35
 Careless air: just drop in to see	2116315894.2546513
 Per second per second	125733.78643044872
 From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice	4386622576778596.0
 Post here	1361.955508855095
 In	167.79392542248092
  He handed the card through the brass grill	2276118727.050871
  —Are there any letters for me? he asked	317122136532.0752
 No answer probably	14009.344185828877
  The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter	550830992911128.6
 He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope	217453300567.46426
  Henry Flower Esq, c/o P	22039311.352788728
   Answered anyhow	1313.00251463088
 Where’s old Tweedy’s regiment? Castoff soldier	109643757.13320743

 Talk: as if that would mend matters	2632400738.5045195
 His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks	1.3016193729985582e+26
 Women will pay a lot of heed, I don’t think	4358564986124.8184

  Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor	5.331557279638717e+18
 The porter hoisted the valise up on the well	33953602010.413612
 She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change	1.4643678284037318e+24

 Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums	6.946219987969486e+27
 Moisture about gives long sight perhaps	12548052.850495897
 Talking of one thing or another	19802763.580128983

  He moved a little to the side of M’Coy’s talking head	3437682392429.2236
 _He’s dead_, he said	354816765.35886806
 _Is it Paddy Dignam_? I said	38929136627.99556

  —One of the best, M’Coy said	4255758743.196246
  The tram passed	17663.211296038837

 Part shares and part profits	3085880.411062642
  M’Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble	2485840422.2622433
  —O, well, he said	410789363.9196952
 That’s good news	13451.339215339027
  He moved to go	191048.1932272824

 You might put down my name at the funeral, will you? I’d like to go but I mightn’t be able, you see	1.1434129691406499e+27
 You just shove in my name if I’m not there, will you?  —I’ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off	1.951119965083002e+29

  —About a fortnight ago, sir?  —Yes, Mr Bloom said	6674584800274835.0
  He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs	7.822030884664566e+23
  —Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water	1.0872294248673716e+19
	13.951045332398436
  It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax	1727228864219.5955
  —And white wax also, he said	3253988569.3235493

 You can pay all together, sir, when you come back	40214547298176.3
  —Good, Mr Bloom said	30454289.378922142
  He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand	1.3275341783732491e+23
  At his armpit Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said:  —Hello, Bloom	4.091182775882919e+16

 Maximum the second	16672.56071395566
  Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly	21876195933.205357
 I was going to throw it away that moment	28007947951.804676
  Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom’s arms	3.2887744633644036e+19
  —I’ll risk it, he said	301451202.5048158
 Here, thanks	18622.62622132347
  He sped off towards Conway’s corner	13936946.877675835
  Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling	6.571695882769591e+19

 Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets	8049199081654.258
 College sports today I see	1437686.494752152
 He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot	1.522152843938151e+23
 Damn bad ad	12597.802135511261
 Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college	8.311118417677006e+17
 Something to catch the eye	2190388.5522226235
  There’s Hornblower standing at the porter’s lodge	142835042.30206013
 How do you do, Mr Hornblower? How do you do, sir?  Heavenly weather really	4.688302457582786e+19
 Cricket weather	1188.770394514949

 Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg	6.216502230548e+18
  Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream	4.422340037673533e+18
 This is my body	182911.47898266316
  He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved	2.2060394095611333e+29
 Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care	28518717096901.773
  —Come on, Simon	2550706.802320512
  —After you, Mr Bloom said	358572374.1240662
  —Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked	263819759094.6047
 Come along, Bloom	212740.84303515623
 He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight	5.932657630682241e+16
 He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue	1.2448289074170685e+23
 One dragged aside: an old woman peeping	1622007539.9318757
 Nose whiteflattened against the pane	2314008.7969140275
 Thanking her stars she was passed over	185005779.02289474
 Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse	3580284890.5006375
 Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming	1976991797247.8738
 Job seems to suit them	1522601.9413440344

 Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket	26949894736.688713
  All waited	1433.810322568159
 Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses’ hoofs	3.013150047156295e+18
 A jolt	2396.30189669142
 Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying	22002089639.30978
 Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind	130528412.41228238
 At walking pace	13797.29211986973
  They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks	6.410004424498068e+19
 Tritonville road	1228.1717412094786
 Quicker	193.68270965874825
  —Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said	22034367.961169988
 Ringsend	129.1501577697265
 Brunswick street	1299.2557271081707
  Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out	20347310.755427524
  —That’s a fine old custom, he said	34447422796.435974
 I am glad to see it has not died out	269593346948.52707
 Respect	127.43187723916472
 The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane	930106599347082.9
 Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat	4.6076960686133837e+18
  —There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said	583880846643534.5
  —Who is that?  —Your son and heir	378918527082.32935
  —Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across	62913338126942.484
  The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels	4.56274916119419e+38
 Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:  —Was that Mulligan cad with him? His _fidus Achates_!  —No, Mr Bloom said	4.0658044350783916e+29
 He was alone	17681.56084051359
  Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road	237859437.87480637

 That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts	4425069637616.421
 But with the help of God and His blessed mother I’ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate	3.383294695025702e+45
 I’ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me	3441584735.4620013
 A counterjumper’s son	23892.364078392286

 Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil	1.727589190734048e+30

  —Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said	2964293636053551.5
 Do you follow me?  He closed his left eye	272284194836.97006
  —What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?  —Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said	2.7242795524059425e+34
  All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats	5.861435711353593e+16
  Mr Bloom set his thigh down	18737818.352025807
 Glad I took that bath	1724995.3568419367
 Feel my feet quite clean	1354289.472439576
 But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better	137844592321.61804
  —After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world	9.034563417766224e+16
 He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes	186534613.92982337
  —And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked	24352589450.477932
  —I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said	346739323044.189
 He said he’d try to come	21465782.485792547
  —What’s wrong?  —We’re stopped	192203321.76010478
  —The grand canal, he said	326552637.07063997
  Gasworks	193.68270965874825
 Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions	2226723200328.637

 Don’t miss this chance	139062.03472859066
 We obey them in the grave	21606369.784056574
 He took it to heart, pined away	4252205757.931202
  A raindrop spat on his hat	29232647.792957276
 He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags	3.6057787512250376e+16
 Apart	128.42105934705512
 Like through a colander	262072.3319673991
 I thought it would	196963.5861279916
 My boots were creaking I remember now	175235095.61886916
  —The weather is changing, he said quietly	36681514665.753136
  —A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said	403327948480996.1
  Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky	6.404276857273639e+20
  —It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said	3100737936321.9062
  The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently	17150246710291.541
  —Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said	289530548618.8668
  —O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly	493069701265337.56
 Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of _The Croppy Boy_	9.907008698628902e+19
 _His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience	1.1634148476525815e+27
  —Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech? Martin Cunningham asked	1853726190462.8438
  —I did not then, Mr Dedalus said	38394100949.914764
  Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket	26567380414.13984
 That book I must change for her	235822103.66998467
  —No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly	41568168170.818504
 Later on please	14507.878707612112

 An hour ago I was passing there	183641583.42573804
 Couldn’t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?  Antient concert rooms	2.052842834203189e+42
 Nothing on there	17066.459403798497

 As broad as it’s long	1562997.2131614925
 Her songs	1433.7852901763297
 Who was he?  —How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute	8.568338667596299e+23
  —He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said	32949751283.38161
 How do you do?  —Who? Mr Dedalus asked	3538750435282.4116
  —Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said	253651301.40899548
 There he is airing his quiff	45779614.0685878
  Mr Dedalus bent across to salute	16464532.056603007
 The nails, yes	242086.26121832718
 Is there anything more in him that they she sees? Fascination	32387568306599.684
 Worst man in Dublin	162966.71660268516
 That keeps him alive	155556.24859738018
 But a type like that	2127520.8137630806
 I am just looking at them: well pared	21233440653.26482
 Body getting a bit softy	2229111.785373663

 In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business	6.560810079816779e+18
 You see the idea is to tour the chief towns	476979021313.70386
 O yes, we’ll have all topnobbers	319620407.02219564

 Doing her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_	22696809180604.543
 No: _vorrei e non_	211003480.9816803
 Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone	47701463275348.84
 A thrush	1585.6243430438467
 There is a word throstle that expresses that	2375740841.9832053
  His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face	16235466758.147146
 Greyish over the ears	173044.2081762103
 I smiled back	16662.04101677919
 A smile goes a long way	21220731.444838103
 Nice fellow	1402.1316725039046
 Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal	7796269531005264.0
 What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury’s	61627425988.86794
  Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power	2103566.657965832
  —Of the tribe of Reuben, he said	46639382851.76088
  A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine	1.8390505879083944e+30
  Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:  —The devil break the hasp of your back!  Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray’s statue	8.807007864249662e+42
  His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes	18858468.878517862
 He caressed his beard, adding:  —Well, nearly all of us	1.0970005646929928e+16
  Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces	361139969096077.1
  —That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son	3.961487822817674e+17
  —About the boatman? Mr Power asked	2724128203.7511897
  —Yes	1764.0732017376129
 I didn’t hear it	186239.2253288045
  —There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were both	3.936286946218026e+35
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
  —What? Mr Dedalus asked	23898946.188858476
 That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?  —Yes, Mr Bloom said	457981137166503.1
 They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown	5055355530563193.0
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
 I wish to Christ he did!  Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils	3.306392408158693e+18
  —No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself	567592514623.7961
	13.951045332398436
  Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:  —Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey	1.4696199596868317e+50
  —For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright	209960723096.4413
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
  A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand	27350987426.873604
  Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage	17667630791.143776
  Mr Dedalus sighed	14605.908016528681
  —The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers	5.562082397811782e+18
 He’s gone from us	164211.53772039237
  —As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said	4.858145004821367e+16
 Heart	141.17410631527423
  Blazing face: redhot	315145.4737789201
 Too much John Barleycorn	206315.5148122888
 Cure for a red nose	1780290.019406569
 Drink like the devil till it turns adelite	2922826531.294415
 A lot of money he spent colouring it	2209759614.1200933
  Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension	418874303114.0522
  —The best death, Mr Bloom said	3914236338.561611
  Their wide open eyes looked at him	183067360.10670578
 Like dying in sleep	164581.34705484327
  No-one spoke	1308.4376807982349
 Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer’s railway guide, civil service college, Gill’s, catholic club, the industrious blind	9.068554767636647e+28
 At night too	16268.367824221552

 A child	1681.8216938675268
 Dwarf’s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box	80970727183571.14

 If not from the man	2435772.1335345437
 Better luck next time	135951.5502617345
  —Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said	2895993450.767708
 It’s well out of it	2236834.151069249
  The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square	210764420661.29684
 Only a pauper	15989.733736613754
  —In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said	433503058648.5827
  —But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life	1.2569327509020077e+21
  Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back	419515239530556.1
  —They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said	1.0079611431358805e+17
  —It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said	45503595711409.55
  Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again	4297615823345.642
 Martin Cunningham’s large eyes	128979.39810528197
 Sympathetic human man he is	2711354.320183147
 They have no mercy on that here or infanticide	23298606408.848408
 Refuse christian burial	10620.686063210693
 As if it wasn’t broken already	15041795.831693927
 Found in the riverbed clutching rushes	25511851.32372036
 And that awful drunkard of a wife of his	54165346457.71127
 Wear the heart out of a stone, that	41506311290.64425

 Start afresh	1768.5507356286635
 Shoulder to the wheel	194589.01993430755
 Drunk about the place and capering with Martin’s umbrella	46807897970.455605
       And they call me the jewel of Asia,      Of Asia,      The geisha	9372396033036170.0
 He knows	1623.289962254815
  That afternoon of the inquest	3320891.725649139
 Stuffy it was	25311.734653081923
 The coroner’s sunlit ears, big and hairy	4971498320.475052
 Had slipped down to the foot of the bed	35137864635.785866
 Death by misadventure	20622.97572337812

  The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street	217289264.57374638
 Over the stones	18508.506061741933
  —We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said	524905436581353.2
  —I hope not, Martin Cunningham said	3015132721.7495394
 That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany	22211641639.37218
 The Gordon Bennett	15496.869484724131
  —Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said	38256638774.54499
  As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls	1.0188307188501798e+25
 Has anybody here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy	1357972462971.6997

 They look terrible the women	1932231.1594850176
 Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me	22460919284204.062
 He’s gone over to the lying-in hospital they told me	243733400694.5711
  The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped	3440400999.160635
  —Emigrants, Mr Power said	36908191.99986639
 Huuuh! out of that!  Thursday, of course	519456258781.6276
 Tomorrow is killing day	214879.24086627184
 Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each	170214646.88472882

 They buy up all the juicy ones	193434540.6364633
 Comes to a big thing in a year	2977870105.2365
 Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla	3643539416205979.0
  —I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said	1.3475103593732308e+24
  —Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said	4882122298105.306
  —Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know	4.5783413672418027e+30
 Don’t you see what I mean?  —O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said	1.0425880025292211e+22
 Pullman car and saloon diningroom	1872391.008114472
  —A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added	278450760350.52637
  —Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus	3991235785296.672
 Wouldn’t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?  —Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted	4.871109813069806e+22
  —And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road	2.0499240005406112e+29
 Terrible!  —First round Dunphy’s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding	33060699665327.758
 Gordon Bennett cup	11223.637875040655
  —Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously	338486450532.52136
 A coffin bumped out on to the road	2838845168.561932
 Burst open	1315.4165313733683
 Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him	4.057028994952288e+20
 Red face: grey now	1679420.7778006578
 Mouth fallen open	13121.58701578881
 Then the insides decompose quickly	2430290.689214486
 The sphincter loose	24829.384752350805
 Seal up all	15101.313901031175
  Dunphy’s corner	1265.2930094222581
 Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief	2323293603.935673
 A pause by the wayside	3133880.512752911
 Expect we’ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health	274881104907890.75
 Elixir of life	15354.306058569573
  But suppose now it did happen	17459416.13593181
 Depends on where	14981.893177225917
 The circulation stops	15251.370168518391
 It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red	377868905851988.8
 An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved	220317809813206.8
  Crossguns bridge: the royal canal	25942567.672667857
 Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal	1.2126232270042877e+20

 Perhaps I will without writing	1600087.5010824152
 With turf from the midland bogs	27092651.90266292
 Salute	128.9617036415809
 He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam	200889050908.32208
  They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house	208300737.37328225
  —I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said	5686679882064270.0
  —Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said	25085397067.300503
  —How is that? Martin Cunningham said	2914225970.808434
  The carriage steered left for Finglas road	167414179.34113896
 The best obtainable	26001.19247813599

  On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton’s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot	2.5528338132123535e+31
  Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses	22336691015051.465
  Mr Power pointed	14106.864473013065
  —So it is, Mr Dedalus said	3911438671.227393
 A gruesome case	23335.07080587021
 Seymour Bushe got him off	1438141.1397476266
 Murdered his brother	14783.36973977798
 Or so they said	195250.74434121515
 Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned	1.6063551699798864e+16
  They looked	1543.9115703466427
 Murderer’s ground	1226.8108426358585
 Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden	39282630.857119665
 Wrongfully condemned	1133.0918138190154
 The murderer’s image in the eye of the murdered	37751792300.1568
 They love reading about it	1827588.4774643502
 Man’s head found in a garden	18189896.054864842

  Cramped in this carriage	241426.52380759307
 She mightn’t like me to come that way without letting her know	26013306481429.387
 Must be careful about women	1542559.607829518
 Catch them once with their pants down	167144118.3890763
 Never forgive you after	161501.69353301695
 Fifteen	132.69116580087143
 Dark poplars, rare white forms	22021625.54955654
 He stepped out	16858.677962717804
 Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed	20448985.435445588
  Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages	218729603.455612
 Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley	3543191762754.4536
 Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit	3986994051361624.0
 Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead	24030415927160.527
 Dogbiscuits	193.68270965874825
 Who ate them? Mourners coming out	170763894.08675334
  He followed his companions	172303.24931864376
 Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths	267010160118999.66
 He handed one to the boy	27112009.705097355
  Where is that child’s funeral disappeared to?  A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block	5.092638498723075e+36
  Coffin now	1376.8536468689886
 Got here before us, dead as he is	30233716492.98774
 Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways	28600950733.769382
 Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something	4.693659854067037e+16
 Do they know what they cart out here every day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day	3.608202888487527e+20
 Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick	382675223.8330437
 Too many in the world	2378116.4095874983
  Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl	3198633349523.3696
 Girl’s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman’s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry	5.817484338919088e+23
 Fish’s face, bloodless and livid	26232192.945443783
 Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath	2385947101.444223
 First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff	427074303609.98206
 Who is that beside them? Ah, the brother-in-law	381099100662.3997
  All walked after	16206.443924567307
  Martin Cunningham whispered:  —I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom	3.7934166890694574e+18
  —What? Mr Power whispered	20844358.27846563
 Had the Queen’s hotel in Ennis	17777927.49309751
 Anniversary	193.68270965874825
 First I heard of it	2421991.992034763
 Poisoned himself?  He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal’s mausoleum	5.424644071721127e+21
 Speaking	131.14245514178307
  —I believe so, Mr Kernan answered	2809901938.7664094
 But the policy was heavily mortgaged	26279113.14534651
 Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s	415711056766303.8
  —A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently	33610543321.97001
  Has the laugh at him now	23457228.390476443
 She had outlived him	257473.04306195548
 Lost her husband	14749.66990681721
 There are more women than men in the world	26164707247.916637
 Condole with her	24386.49351061832
 She would marry another	148815.2034822091
 Yet who knows after	154091.82733061485
 Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died	34839723826.70656
 Victoria and Albert	14363.60570506999
 But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet	55405970186389.25
 All for a shadow	206288.07149840426

 Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting	4321017894885365.5
  —How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands	3793055306974365.0
 Haven’t seen you for a month of Sundays	3175620842.64673
  —Never better	17215.69992268314
 How are all in Cork’s own town?  —I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said	8.963579013315994e+26
 Same old six and eightpence	1619179.115134336
 Stopped with Dick Tivy	191237.51483175872
  —By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder	32200146462960.51
 A few bob a skull	1905362.094998691
 John Henry Menton is behind	1594797.3308526005
 He put down his name for a quid	2759640220.1719894
  —I’ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said	46205241125.917816
 John Henry is not the worst in the world	35838112557.9544
  —How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked	262536466921.69684
 Liquor, what?  —Many a good man’s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh	6.04391421336354e+18
 Poor boy! Was he there when the father? Both unconscious	48613066653432.69

 I owe three shillings to O’Grady	24540049.994600702
 Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel	50432096775679.9
 He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously	4.0434027656761475e+20
 The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s belly	6.415059908991206e+27
 Who’ll read the book? I, said the rook	603996421640.6239
  They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak	9.97874668287551e+20

  The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server	453156323933252.25
 Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart	2.176742921460274e+27
 Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket	2342744244437.548
 He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left	5825414422424029.0
  —The O’Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him	374177118575.9883
  —He’s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O’	1.1580408133215489e+21
 Let Him take me whenever He likes	172164920.6877435
  —I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp	40071925592956.66
 I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven	3564572469181.055
  Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by	3456802875659275.5
  Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head	2390854954446.267
 We are the last	214813.70996191658
 This cemetery is a treacherous place	26387402.245013524

 Hope he’ll say something else	1271910.2022510746
  Mr Kernan added:  —The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say	1.3189644510283752e+25
 The language of course was another thing	247200215.47810408
  Mr Kernan said with solemnity:  —_I am the resurrection and the life_	1.2409170738264294e+18
 That touches a man’s inmost heart	23868032.821237233
  —It does, Mr Bloom said	342225553.438295
  Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies? No touching that	8.707930344745708e+25

  Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side	1428195682.9303339
  —As it should be, Mr Kernan said	34939663062.54603
  —Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked	2935781880550283.0
  Ned Lambert glanced back	132316.7274494941
  —Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano	1.5872133844044813e+21
 She’s his wife	16047.712262341816
  —O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said	4243360832507.1377
 I haven’t seen her for some time	200669098.64311814
 I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown	4.92255489835335e+19
 And a good armful she was	24793106.837830223
  He looked behind through the others	22146989.673940834
  Ned Lambert smiled	13362.86870795879
  —Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely’s	72867606521028.5
 A traveller for blottingpaper	253034.02651833222
  —In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for? She had plenty of game in her then	1.3686269825900453e+30
 He does some canvassing for ads	15826168.819932498
  The barrow turned into a side lane	208069411.6158518
  —John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased	2420521386.1728544
 He never forgets a friend	2846358.8839688622
  Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence	1868775637.33572
  —My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice	39916569854842.695
 I don’t want your custom at all	196588865.5325149
  Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back	3.776041275277946e+22
  —Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?  —I did not, Martin Cunningham said	1.9165372538614755e+27
 The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles	5.188687262920972e+23
  —They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs	2.914253215605474e+30
 After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough	27718599220145.723
 One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy	4519952961215.067
 He resumed:  —And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he	3.057466253680989e+28
 _That’s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_	6989119627997371.0
  —I know, Hynes said	28484476.992512967
  —To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said	369120843061.2659
 It’s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else	2532768443.592103
 Decent fellow, John O’Connell, real good sort	20275468921.464115
 Keys: like Keyes’s ad: no fear of anyone getting out	31278296125471.926
 No passout checks	18890.546947837305
 I must see about that ad after the funeral	27975185239.475075
 Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha? Hope it’s not chucked in the dead letter office	8.719488483693225e+29
 Be the better of a shave	27721580.724249367
 Grey sprouting beard	11345.632832971403
 Come out and live in the graveyard	415010512.58488274

 Eight children he has anyway	1407079.6627675171
  He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field	3.508004460856725e+19
 Holy fields	1254.867148415521
 Sitting or kneeling you couldn’t	1482661.3560471889
 Standing? His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing	5.486506104496648e+19
 All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong cells	66881060974.12354
 And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings	55632440333305.086
 His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome	153955281.42159867
 Well, so it is	2733301.463030798
 Ought to be flowers of sleep	19545105.558904964

  —Two, Corny Kelleher said	23434280.358058237
 Half ten and eleven	160236.03129456824
  The caretaker put the papers in his pocket	2907136966.2721148

 We come to bury Cæsar	2348180.115977707
 His ides of March or June	24695747.6439615
 He doesn’t know who is here nor care	1962883358.0396187
 Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I’d like to know? Now I’d give a trifle to know who he is	5.211881615398011e+33
 Always someone turns up you never dreamt of	1835139217.3209898
 A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life	428961997510.2778
 Yes, he could	235367.82555297785
 Still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave	3.138423423003762e+20
 Only man buries	14010.941248271978
 No, ants too	294135.27457524324
 First thing strikes anybody	122924.68584940112
 Well then Friday buried him	1445879.5848977396
 Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it	25480431066197.574
       O, poor Robinson Crusoe!      How could you possibly do so?  Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box	1.5013566795679734e+27
 When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood	330399282907424.0
 They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way	4.258536873575587e+19
 Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’s	22784112917618.816
 I see what it means	2013345.0080878322
 The Irishman’s house is his coffin	21839121.2561108
  Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads	5.5099255630873504e+17
 Twelve	133.44010369725606
 The chap in the macintosh is thirteen	282352308.31760037
 Death’s number	1227.2898084282099
 Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn’t in the chapel, that I’ll swear	6.517128799385169e+19
 I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west	27064875169899.43
 Dressy fellow he was once	1740542.552551066
 Hello	135.66272367026838
  The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles	2.4341362350928763e+18
  Pause	128.1473073803608
  If we were all suddenly somebody else	146774100.0788453

 Never see a dead one, they say	3032664744.1002
 They hide	1419.612319579856
 Also poor papa went away	1372973.9549003784
 Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker	2512615827.1529727
 Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next	207605213440.34308
 Well, it is a long rest	319383981.35626525
 Feel no more	15569.115933878444
 Must be damned unpleasant	132814.96024596164
 Can’t believe it at first	1767887.3029827785
 I haven’t yet	14863.78693884229

 Delirium all you hid all your life	263244973.22521704
 The death struggle	16593.59231736708
 His sleep is not natural	1832341.2227577835
 Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow	4.929079955585154e+17
 Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he’s doomed	2823763982665859.0
 Devil in that picture of sinner’s death showing him a woman	3818629621625.7427

 Don’t forget to pray for him	20524790.685667675
 Even Parnell	1309.732996999421
 Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other	405195953645743.25
  We are praying now for the repose of his soul	285257134040.12665
 Hoping you’re well and not in hell	199643641.40476114
 Nice change of air	161691.67269626036
 Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory	6049465122993.648
 Someone walking over it	163787.0832186601
 Near you	1602.3366040233184
 Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought	247926111461.8873
 Monday he died	14621.795695576358
 They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole	2.2679765861983803e+32
 Flag of distress	21453.734524901585
 Rather long to keep them in summer	205233623.48092636
 Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no	3.5898773837509203e+17
  The clay fell softer	150768.28744137447
 Out of sight, out of mind	298434713.5491909
 The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show	4.084002202506391e+16
 Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields	56380394998098.57

 Ah, the names	227321.83401470256

  —Charley, Hynes said writing	19974525.038382683
 He was on the _Freeman_ once	3893747511.360369
  So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne	6217036566140721.0
 Good idea a postmortem for doctors	25176035.911727633
 Find out what they imagine they know	187615946.20319137
 He died of a Tuesday	2158909.7799361795
 Got the run	18234.035142935663
 I saw to that, M’Coy	28694468.249769554
 Thanks, old chap: much obliged	299236003.70686543
 Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing	3598577511.8303766
  —And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the	2.7002251526047364e+24

 Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said	45486552258.72204
  —No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping	399727208702.8855
 I say, Hynes!  Didn’t hear	234316108.39601278
 Well of all the	253308.81047931022
 Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell	10934527155.712025
 Good Lord, what became of him?  A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade	6.331466532688607e+22
  —O, excuse me!  He stepped aside nimbly	252912298436.85828
  Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole	489522762077125.56
 Nearly over	1377.5435939873753
 The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump	7.224600951714326e+16
 Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean	371768127256.55914
 One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass	66685075158236.836
 The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand	37967470632183.12
 I know that	19481.395135475366
  —Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said	50458681897377.06
 We have time	16555.61514019545
  —Let us, Mr Power said	286071621.2977902
  They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts	298951667754.4758
 With awe Mr Power’s blank voice spoke:  —Some say he is not in that grave at all	4.466990413468618e+20
 That the coffin was filled with stones	229541099.28579938
 That one day he will come again	248772038.67519587
  Hynes shook his head	152088.99537910384
  —Parnell will never come again, he said	32710641338.820343
 He’s there, all that was mortal of him	36413634114.88943
 Peace to his ashes	169211.24784675497
  Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland’s hearts and hands	1.2987114783221712e+33
 Pray for the repose of the soul of	3557084615.751702

 Why this infliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy	2.119731675719655e+34

  John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving	1704033895225.3398
  —There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also	27257191266.725933
  John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve	1.0895950915243591e+23
 He clapped the hat on his head again	4385070966.273757

  A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word:  _—Freeman!_  Mr Bloom said slowly:  —Well, he is one of our saviours also	9.511779368621965e+43
  A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards	7.047803581590469e+34
 But will he save the circulation? Thumping	2290185894.4967947

 Wait a moment	16977.576184068283
 Let me say one thing	1798103.5976221487
 The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society	1.070517340931788e+23

 Go on	1642.2664439073346
 Well?  —It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement	7.807483031298156e+51
 It was then a new movement	22835636.845590923
 We were weak, therefore worthless	24687595.337528665
  IMPROMPTU   In ferial tone he addressed J	339914531.30706984
 O’Molloy:  —Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed	5.444395714241826e+16
 That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall	9.666738607086344e+21
 He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man	1.1573827311149534e+22

 O’Molloy’s towards Stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking	3132906308727759.5
  He raised his head firmly	1740503.8645309429
 His eyes bethought themselves once more	23732238.006753575
 Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet	1095403152964859.2
  He began:  _—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend	2.618119781945154e+36
 It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses	5.221960721882244e+53
_  His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech	6.527147909587148e+22
_ Noble words coming	160258.91325297704
 Look out	1542.3541940920002
 Could you try your hand at it yourself?  _—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride	2.615576428982466e+37
 I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me	3225900119572.9233
_  FROM THE FATHERS   It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted	8.203810350466822e+34
  _—Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people	1.8251913859843055e+32
 You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe	1.7584052612769415e+37

  _—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra	1.1161364184232455e+34
 Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas	52768411962302.1
 Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms	3.2395675458866758e+19
 He lifted his voice above it boldly:  _—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day	4.5860966950881436e+73
 He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw	1.3233479846021511e+48
_  He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence	3765218994722.1016

  —He is, Stephen said	35296931.286019266
 The boy of act one is the mature man of act five	61587713746157.125
 All in all	20142.45718938038
 He acts and is acted on	21896177.39108687
 His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer	1.306852646219924e+18

  —Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said	2808457771311.1953
 He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth	1.3372847817483518e+49

  _—Eureka!_ Buck Mulligan cried	2607583245.2508492
 _Eureka!_  Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton’s desk	4.3953989642883784e+18
  —May I? he said	28753802.3663133
  He began to scribble on a slip of paper	42187772826.11406
  —Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live	1.3588574325058155e+22
 The rest shall keep as they are	223830116.87113827
  He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor	1381836379139474.8

  —For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview	712255341218365.1
  Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice:  —I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore	1.0617781560477115e+68
  Come, Kinch	18361.84207193006

 One thinks of Homer	244808.410107809
  He stopped at the stairfoot	1989553.540254418
  —I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly	736135822370799.1
  The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined	246487541.04777136
  In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:  _Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky Mulligan	5.588988349737604e+34
_   He turned a happy patch’s smirk to Stephen, saying:  —The disguise, I fear, is thin	3.819651957336331e+23
  He read, _marcato:_  —Characters:       TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)      CRAB (a bushranger)      MEDICAL DICK )          and      ) (two birds with one stone)      MEDICAL DAVY )      MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)      FRESH NELLY          and      ROSALIE (the coalquay whore)	1.8692206248078618e+55
  He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:  —O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!  —The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them	inf

  A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes	3.3667043501874227e+18
 He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S	8.829138384207832e+27
 Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown	5.700724373465877e+19
  Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square	14150385.008783268
 He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days	1.6137884523682802e+62

 And you, father?  Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed	3153681529501.1426
 He would go to Buxton probably for the waters	39176043683.890335
 And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London	2237649918.805028
 The house was still sitting, to be sure it was	4656900893747.207
 Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed	185399192.47841948
 A wonderful man really	169605.93571423067
 Yes, he would certainly call	22976365.82975185
  —Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy	19035872.39524593
  Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun	1.8268924075164876e+27
 And smiled yet again, in going	281931474.29300576
 He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste	51029245348533.43
  Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice	4.157231378172336e+21
 Beyond a doubt	15427.051880616546
 He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish	63306337920526.055
 Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?  O, lest he forget	6.594470976369871e+21
 That letter to father provincial	1794804.956233647
  Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square	19860235679637.918
 The little house	19458.9683487595
 That was very good now	2010932.7251121511
 And his name? Ger	3237760.3564409763
 O, that was a very nice name to have	415173726142.5485
  —But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said	6.320719865107354e+17
  The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:  —O, sir	60410402222420.055
  —Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said	5.720609271059149e+17
  Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox	1.2153912165986227e+25
 Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east	192847364211550.28
  Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court	2.3779975804001732e+58
  Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?  Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed	1.2752485507440146e+27
 How did she do?  A fine carriage she had	282984902957.13416
 Like Mary, queen of Scots, something	4061750330.8815327
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
 what should he say?	2092086.292747678
	13.951045332398436
  Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left	4.295325943238266e+18
 The reverend T	17274.919961573825

) speak	1563.530876676811
 The incumbent they called him	2040901.4944772297
 He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words	3240632452082.252
 But one should be charitable	1641290.1679939975
 Invincible ignorance	1764.4336892760566
 They acted according to their lights	14751365.390238015
  Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road	24708299440640.21
 It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare	4.089080750353606e+16
 All raised untidy caps	185282.69849650288
 Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly	2011171888.39955
  Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked	2153100275337.185
 Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament	22952427490.52768
 Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered	3557145673.900615
  Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman	358033435177.9727
 And now it was an office or something	2656391700.046127
  Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop	5.2611994756354665e+26
 Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter	5.4036491317829095e+20
 He passed Grogan’s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York	4.312107895501877e+19
 Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared	4951476504.278806
  Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged	6.011489136896365e+17
 They saluted him and were saluted	19284773.650113583
  Father Conmee passed H	138647.269275821
 J	143.8452884389744
 O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay	3.949922005430464e+19
 A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable	2684805968589092.5
 In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes	2.019534585727062e+25
  Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him	2.0907510272259978e+43
 It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people	1.0547976830963598e+47
  On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S	19777027829.35115
 J	143.8452884389744
  Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C	1283067629742.7815
 of saint Agatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge	426019696583843.9
  At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island	6.2343044135336726e+25
  Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse	4.112897992962259e+45
 The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap	8.948661176344216e+21
 Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum	1105149.6330708428
 The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down	2989590991280152.5
 His wife, Father Conmee supposed	20138468.798229206
 A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses	6.908469749271224e+16
 He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat	9.749932690549319e+22
  Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head	8.1536106499892e+24
  At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight	1.3839647101586415e+27
 She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been absolved, _pray for me	1.0710312819258428e+78
_ But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures	9.382127964407834e+17
  From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee	251363137489874.78
 J	143.8452884389744
 That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea	2.132914297834108e+23
 Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D	3.509261237693366e+22
V	130.31611444262805
) been brought	16020.810410398524
 But they were God’s souls, created by God	21309435674.89921
  At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn	6.964479626562196e+20
 It pleased Father Conmee, road and name	2508084050.4305735
 Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining	2.5838210582129844e+16
 Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day	6.833805335955734e+18
  A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged	1.104507726658505e+38
  Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore	309669551858.3344
 He was humane and honoured there	20425680.152730584
 He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters	6.740212064068163e+24
 And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee	2.2652022266418427e+23
  It was a charming day	2116533.6384063205
 The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind	2.9462585278310436e+16
 He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening	2.3742936221399223e+30
 He was their rector: his reign was mild	34585484604.06861
  Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out	48412620983765.37
  Nones	193.68270965874825
 He should have read that before lunch	198420659.67596912
 But lady Maxwell had come	1542385.2281751428
  Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast	7.282041386584174e+17
 _Deus in adiutorium	255655.62364036823
_  A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand	8.661239105103608e+27
 The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig	4.054966299535892e+26
 There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out	1.1895734190970614e+22
  Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge	2633961536806.334
  —That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher	2876927750.524255
  —It’s very close, the constable said	2875158913.111787
  Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin	4.1267652641580725e+28
  —What’s the best news? he asked	2823302380.847946
  —I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath	5.272350873748246e+16
 Towards Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:  —_For England_	9.745836337628905e+20
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
  He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled:  —_home and beauty	4.1911219284706664e+21
_  J	1751.8341422542826
 J	143.8452884389744
 The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides	7.297049290962671e+22
  He halted and growled angrily:  —_For England_	3469740009215.8086
	13.951045332398436
  Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths	5.770008824792423e+22
  He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply:  —_home and beauty	7.435450521428735e+26
 The blind of the window was drawn aside	2882678303.6573644
 A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell	44537297238825.164
 A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps	6.422393616737876e+20
 A woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings	2078801062751.5962
  *    *    *   Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen	4.293426232331401e+16
  Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow	9.285128665219532e+21
  —They wouldn’t give anything on them, she said	359344185877.0787
  Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table	2216908788797.985
  —Bad cess to her big face! she cried	382813192156.17755
  Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes	226166406214.42773
  —What’s in the pot? she asked	3237544917.0420628
  —Peasoup, Maggy said	3152211.8388482067
  —Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said	195206390.6606683
  The lacquey rang his bell	1778431.2386351565
  —Barang!  Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:  —Give us it here	5.0428776372928225e+19
  Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl	1622687032613.284
 Where’s Dilly?  —Gone to meet father, Maggy said	2826042638388.95
  Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey’s bowl, exclaimed:  —Boody! For shame!  A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George’s quay	8.833822019216168e+66
  —Yes, sir, the blond girl said	42742237081.48147
 And the fruit on top	2343799.4769506953
  —That’ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said	275551243577.0956
  She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches	4.5927528254191994e+17
  Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells	7.475563496362556e+29

’S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal	8.667868597055232e+17
  He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain’s length	1.7862732178630493e+25
  —Can you send them by tram? Now?  A darkbacked figure under Merchants’ arch scanned books on the hawker’s cart	6.744864348097818e+24
  —Certainly, sir	216888.3144711488
 Ten minutes	1264.4583732064982
  —Will you write the address, sir?  Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her	8.33497818553168e+22
  —Send it at once, will you? he said	4890428370158.227
 I will, sir	235257.88065394462
  The blond girl’s slim fingers reckoned the fruits	1551587259.8801203
 A young pullet	24345.725198559485
 He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass	54737541182.39099
  —This for me? he asked gallantly	4198908145.4272914
  The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing	8.049632130189263e+21
  *    *    *   _—Ma!_ Almidano Artifoni said	2325481754377.8916
  He gazed over Stephen’s shoulder at Goldsmith’s knobby poll	18938978933.545235
  Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests	9.095389895345726e+16
  —_Anch’io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand’ ero giovine come Lei	4.302850942328179e+23

  By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band	6.148467113503453e+22
  —_Ci rifletterò,_ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg	6604992313796862.0
  His heavy hand took Stephen’s firmly	14447670.804728983
 Human eyes	1417.3442128304418
  _—Eccolo,_ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste	4247923225900.0674
 _Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi	497756025.6583415
 Addio, caro	35431.82415808281

 _Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!_  Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram	2.2643427057201e+34
  *    *    *   Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_ far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter	6.234622144811758e+34
 Is he in love with that one, Marion? Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye	1.3809061901516923e+21

  Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses	1.96314341466298e+29
 She’s not nicelooking, is she? The way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt	8.628036132943355e+18
 Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight	24208451830.208977
 If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle’s	7498535926538910.0
 They kick out grand	147131.72796034062
 Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her	43574747665853.875
 Hope to goodness he won’t keep me here till seven	192252783366.80032
  The telephone rang rudely by her ear	167742631.12431568

  —Who’s that? Ned Lambert asked	212178692.7574225
 Is that Crotty?  —Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold	7.470860237652021e+16
  —Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches	9.315922351102129e+24
 Mind your steps there	150897.60566336595
  The vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall	6.043937140744955e+19
 At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them	1941060350912705.8
 We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary’s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534	2.575086158529694e+22
 The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road	3.367980384745451e+35
 You were never here before, Jack, were you?  —No, Ned	7.378642329386168e+16
  —He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me	6.26433252167499e+19
 The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court	46923692708.11029
  —That’s right, Ned Lambert said	245573294.53062624
  —If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps	1.5120121108678752e+22

  —Certainly, Ned Lambert said	22772177.905041825
 Bring the camera whenever you like	27895563.811349947
 I’ll get those bags cleared away from the windows	16596658461.186779
 You can take it from here or from here	27016198929.670815
  In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor	1.1639951900483499e+25
  From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard	32947597557136.965

  —You’re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said	29566441269.97862
 Next week, say	177071.48265164316
 Can you see?  —Yes, yes	3474012496.3053255
 Very pleased to have met you	19668955.296823107

  Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air	2270339695.39882

 I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral	4.493544828054821e+20

  With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly	7.0012685354850976e+19
  —Chow! he said	2201572.265607758
 Blast you!  —The dust from those sacks, J	3262902640046.252

 In here, see	239794.60991169407
  He slid it into the left slot for them	26619411494.312466
 It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six	5.1096312135419635e+17
  Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude	6.262290253618642e+65
 The impact	2569.158544493488
 So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over	4.859986405927502e+18
  —I’ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him	7.526912665893355e+16
 One good turn deserves another	1436993.5023033842
 Tell him I’m Boylan with impatience	16392824.854762843

 See you later	15557.302313305534
  He followed M’Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court	3269947141325.032
  —He’s a hero, he said simply	3222431819.9572835
  —I know, M’Coy said	28526372.369191214
 The drain, you mean	3850555.1558459415
 It was down a manhole	2155381.915557317
 Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky’s vest and all, with the rope round him	5.996001270453888e+17

 Who’s riding her?  —O	19678524.596044246
 Madden, Lenehan said	195904.7864397522

  —Even money, Lenehan said returning	221945685.20089906
 Through here	1493.7861928387163

  A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street	5.8800918453460056e+16
  He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh	449596118228418.7
  —But wait till I tell you, he said	428803662736.2992
 Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher	656807241945423.5
 Bloom and the wife were there	28563399.827057354

 We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the morning after the night before	1.6096383762630012e+27
 Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s night on the Featherbed Mountain	24185757743437.348
 Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other	1.2332831979998902e+22
 She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband	7859628312817754.0
 Hell’s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her	23196344656754.348

 Know what I mean?  His hands moulded ample curves of air	23038239719917.19
 He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips	5.863083452502905e+21
  —The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh	494658413252758.6
 Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot	5.113526635198637e+36
 He knows them all, faith	23521387.01882849
 At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away	373158123320.3988
 _And what star is that, Poldy?_ says she	58650106740418.555
 By God, she had Bloom cornered	372525351.0052135
 _That one, is it?_ says Chris Callinan, _sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick	1.754833254869922e+24
 Lenehan walked on again	169447.1441001537
 He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly	43703936162.71713

 There’s a touch of the artist about old Bloom	30641908966.579956
  *    *    *   Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_, then of Aristotle’s _Masterpiece	8.133671687685982e+25

 Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world	37920487389311.42
 All butting with their skulls to get out of it	443014258032.34705
  —That I had, he said, pushing it by	6340625220169.811
  —Them are two good ones, he said	32340545105.88167
 He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain	1.465030389776503e+27
 Had it? Yes	209264.0882791105
  He opened it	17929.21617646807
 Thought so	1496.443443115703
  A woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain	184925671.3294009
  He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_	3870397434674.085
 More in her line	183722.87670442433

  _—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies	9.887172780161682e+21

 The end	1831.3368427650985
  —You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare	6.11925847134898e+16
  The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint	4.584005738023416e+17
  Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman	33159493157.398197

 The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing	8562037323426087.0

 That’s a good one	200333.60195730138

 Any advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings	178162469550.81406

 Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back	2734568870911.732
 You’ll get curvature of the spine	27673353.022038806
 Do you know what you look like?  He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw	2.5682275372066977e+27
  —Give it up, father, Dilly said	39948430966.51182
 All the people are looking at you	266539454.0979947
  Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache	1909022035508.7698
  —Did you get any money? Dilly asked	23145614928.036163
  —Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said	306267894881.4479
  —You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes	54630964418237.29
  Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James’s street	3.4539162219331686e+17
  —I know you did, Dilly answered	2943048132.090127
 Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy? Here	559418900654329.2
  He handed her a shilling	2038325.4218663091
  —See if you can do anything with that, he said	49969320671396.06
  —I suppose you got five, Dilly said	30480046487.090427
  —Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly	3380964684.4206553

  —Barang!  —Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him	6.533553075170289e+18
  The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly:  —Bang!  Mr Dedalus stared at him	7.310224872602688e+26
  —Watch him, he said	31376204.193293624
 It’s instructive	1312.6067097862563
  —I’m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said	465063297656288.2
 I’ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews	21427694684.607666
 Look, there’s all I have	25938154.277353548
  He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously	207906335592.2733
  Mr Dedalus thought and nodded	1765455.398775633
  —I will, he said gravely	336546060.9576378
 I looked all along the gutter in O’Connell street	38319553703.21545

  —I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said	274168846485.80478
  The lacquey banged loudly	147336.01553690838
  Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently:  —The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn’t do anything! O, sure they wouldn’t really!

  —Jolly, Mr Dedalus said	25396548.689959556
 Who is it?  —O, Father Cowley said	411382138121.8606
  —The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered	36152137924.19662
 I’m just waiting for Ben Dollard	15794202.587079806
 All I want is a little time	280520031.5496051
 Poor old bockedy Ben! He’s always doing a good turn for someone	323330739294505.25
 Hold hard!  He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant	3.162403066260813e+17
  As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:  —Hold that fellow with the bad trousers	4.3460231208316045e+17
  —Hold him now, Ben Dollard said	2692923036.0542736
  Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard’s figure	129241718122672.06
 Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:  —That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?  —Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw	2.096064295525938e+57
  He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:  —They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow	1.0600838192174438e+42
  —Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said	596567113769993.0
 Thanks be to God he’s not paid yet	1884240860.1914458
  Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club	2.5308932148185257e+18
  Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth a deep note	4.495125425606224e+17
  —Aw! he said	3341914.3660593885
  —What about that? Ben Dollard said	2741238842.332951
  The reverend Hugh C	158044.36582275692
 Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles	6.996146062174743e+35
  Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air	6.827099127447148e+20
  —Come along with me to the subsheriff’s office, he said	79130958091379.06
 He’s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun	379739374.81438965
 Come along	1465.8308215803427
 I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don’t	1.1659278459613195e+23
	13.951045332398436
  —For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously	32847463681753.95
  —What few days? he boomed	209242935.55738622
  —Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben Dollard said	5.444092756858247e+18
 I gave him all the particulars	23638865.541155104
 29 Windsor avenue	10378.221046471543
 But are you sure of that?  —You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts	3.371301223450615e+32
  He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk	2152109974592.0503
  —Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them	2.0809214783168192e+24
  *    *    *   —The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate	2.0271916272408506e+25
  The policeman touched his forehead	1766885.3223762962
  —God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily	311457357077.68726
  He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street	3.6795688310452433e+19
  Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel	3.440511153284028e+21
 I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him	32882545722433.43
  —You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward	3514401412074.745
  John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill	3.2873662276120687e+19
  On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending	3.886167255794281e+21
  The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street	12652955013.205202
  —Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_ office	1.1385073373118553e+21
 And put down the five shillings too	244752111.78060675
  —Without a second word either, Mr Power said	305017144184.6299
  —Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added	2116207905.154497
  They went down Parliament street	1567809.3203569152
  —There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s	462672023310882.75
  Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties	6.796609057741428e+22
  John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches	1.0279938688752009e+40
  —The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power	5.2751693830061875e+19
  They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms	15598590116.132418
 The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate	2569621118846.298
 Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance	2.923209927941448e+18
  The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood	306199473953221.1
  —Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted	5.6850487311283085e+17
 He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces	6.737959940856447e+19
  Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language	4.151726560329281e+19
 Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber	7.281048806606424e+18
 And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him	2.928405755514501e+48
  Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips	2089342878044.6187
 Come upstairs for goodness’ sake till I sit down somewhere	1530603705329.2725
  —Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff	4504503410844.99
  With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in	20030983923.571003
  —Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror	1.2280961749949971e+28
  Long John Fanning could not remember him	168690253.50356254
  All turned where they stood	1736043.3336257378
 John Wyse Nolan came down again	14751809.236887636
 From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering	1.1261564199998099e+24
 In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders	2695632189681.0947
  —What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase	6.693118951049426e+17
  —The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot	4.070777966066055e+18
  *    *    *   As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines:  —Parnell’s brother	3.9407120633208454e+23
 There in the corner	237210.92217594202
  They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard	5.919345675245492e+24
  —Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat	716753401519348.5
  —Yes, Mulligan said	2677103.553053288
  John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested	5.433306701670828e+22
  —Two _mélanges,_ Buck Mulligan said	54763515719.420135
 And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well	38204432221141.89
  When she had gone he said, laughing:  —We call it D	4926250778448167.0
C	138.9578885370511
 O, but you missed Dedalus on _Hamlet	31222142486.314922
_  Haines opened his newbought book	25515974.87778885
  —I’m sorry, he said	27448210.100357562
 Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance	406622942222589.0
	13.951045332398436
  Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter	13646358547.964437
  —You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance	5.040774291500065e+16
  —I am sure he has an _idée fixe,_ Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger	1.4254709251828983e+25
  Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely	174343320.28012887
  —They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell	6672692466673484.0
 That is his tragedy	200362.83909317965
 He can never be a poet	22296591.615048673
 The joy of creation	196425.47529797364
	13.951045332398436
  —Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly	34152670861.926987
 I see	1702.2874585212412
 I tackled him this morning on belief	279114436.53150356
 There was something on his mind, I saw	35914142084.380486
 He helped her to unload her tray	286019123.310291
 Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea	17755540345.128384
 Does he write anything for your movement?  He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream	3.4638800858924964e+21
 Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith	2.4766003875934268e+16
 He bit off a soft piece hungrily	183315254.6817753
 He is going to write something in ten years	26768649743.21764
 Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all	441063341823.0645
  He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup	2708542135877.093
  —This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance	4381750580969605.5
 I don’t want to be imposed on	229837668.5248006
  *    *    *   Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell’s yard	184007056954297.16
 Behind him Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith’s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square	6.636447849110305e+30
 Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park	4.148912700676223e+16
  At the corner of Wilde’s house he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke’s lawn	3.045016254345309e+29
 His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun	191882577.62179706
 The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form	3483944631499.471
 It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s	4.63581714429515e+43
  After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him	5949337153932637.0
 He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props	1.20435661472557e+19
 I could easy do a bunk on ma	2915601972.0865674
 That’s me in mourning	177713.04153438986
 Sure, the blooming thing is all over	2995841896.3866124
 One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man	6.535652643852507e+20
 But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all	3.5833563576721115e+23
  In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time	3.2933842521165066e+38
  No Sandymount tram	13224.330347662026
  Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand	2715362707690223.5
 I’m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday	160232270683.18488
 He met other schoolboys	150192.10368567877
 Do they notice I’m in mourning? Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight	2.9450188239421215e+18
  His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye	9.012917561741109e+25
 A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking	578883081252.3448
 How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney’s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt	5.76853984688524e+42
 Never see him again	175890.56835239858
 Death, that is	242757.35119331934
 Pa is dead	14919.25336857107
 My father is dead	176200.0360180028
 I couldn’t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better	7.893250184621584e+22
 I hope he’s in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night	3.002460773146374e+18

 From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan’s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage	7.418629600481972e+23

 On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M’Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by	4.171991215839355e+19
 Passing by Roger Greene’s office and Dollard’s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby’s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn’t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring’s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant	5.576928477383007e+74
 Beyond Lundy Foot’s from the shaded door of Kavanagh’s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland	4.7419899573351836e+27
 The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G	2534250480835.1523

 Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently	1.2021093965533445e+36
 Where the foreleg of King Billy’s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders	2.15381241788224e+26
 She shouted in his ear the tidings	233671122.84949258

  When all agog miss Douce said eagerly:  —Look at the fellow in the tall silk	4.4161428258700396e+18

  She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath	2.9117185457546644e+24
  Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear	2.6882822066648344e+16
 Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear	1529152746933.2185
  —It’s them has the fine times, sadly then she said	37727791137126.2

 And  —There’s your teas, he said	3339890652.877237
  Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low	9.634440135853014e+20

  Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce  —Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated	7.031435533169906e+21
  Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:  —O, don’t remind me of him for mercy’ sake!  —But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated	3.879183545326799e+39
  Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers	1.328589737962571e+16
  —No, don’t, she cried	358081836.13451827
  Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again:  —Don’t let me think of him or I’ll expire	2.3477169038083447e+30
  —Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings	1.1073260186497112e+21
 Hufa! Hufa!  Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy’s throat	186037610456867.66
 Will you ever forget his goggle eye?  Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:  —And your other eye!  Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner’s name	3.8762784929213803e+34

 Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:  —O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried	3.0513731214846914e+57
  —Married to the greasy nose! she yelled	25499803840.555176

  Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe	26591578339861.62
 I didn’t recognise him for the moment	242894000.09046003
 Have you seen him lately?  He had	2487871307.13972

 In Mooney’s _en ville_ and in Mooney’s _sur mer	89613053781867.69
  He smiled at bronze’s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:  —The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips	1.7604907414905734e+26

 A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated	1.3417038141484996e+69

 Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects	5.431596225871125e+58

  —Stand and deliver, says he	295456652.9183343
  —That’s all right, citizen, says Joe	36235871235.4607
  —Pass, friends, says he	340755015.8550763
  Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:  —What’s your opinion of the times?  Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill	3.2151133185095534e+30
 But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion	378850875353.52374
  —I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork	1.4231965980678525e+21
  So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:  —Foreign wars is the cause of it	8.805333703823651e+23
  And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:  —It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise	8.91003467678542e+19

 And how’s the old heart, citizen? says he	435718824881.1536
  —Never better, _a chara_, says he	6339510913155.47
 From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_)	3.879043594629581e+53
 The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest	3.9100091446398374e+33
 The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower	5.517952514759988e+24
 A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble	4.410361883624571e+57
  He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes	2.237777767362298e+35
 Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut	41224038971401.79
 His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast	2.9451904530747577e+33
 From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O’Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O’Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O’Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M’Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S	inf

  Terence O’Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda	1.0829522425108199e+42

 Hangmen’s letters	1869.2567134443761
  So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket	6.599487442819572e+16
  —Honest injun, says Alf	19292835.12546918
 Read them	1509.751990897543
  So Joe took up the letters	20960544.37149015
  —Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran	266557726065.97543
  So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust	481903752666990.6
 Bob’s a queer chap when the porter’s up in him so says I just to make talk:  —How’s Willy Murray those times, Alf?  —I don’t know, says Alf	2.1063117574853286e+36
 I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam	2382434411197.4844
 Only I was running after that	21927805.410789527
	13.951045332398436
  —You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters	4321936298350.464
  —Ay, says Joe	2357837.8516493943
  —Sure I’m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff	6.156615984952675e+20
  —Who’s dead? says Bob Doran	183115008.7780927
  —You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm	5.118778281574265e+16
  —What? says Alf	2198042.5399573795
 Good Christ, only five	1809429.2782523194
 What?	1731.6211576036244
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
 And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim’s	627407151686692.6
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
 Who’s talking about	13933.503220526216
	13.951045332398436
  —Maybe so, says Joe	24164265.40289614
  —Paddy? says Alf	1949068.0613730818
  —Ay, says Joe	2357837.8516493943
 He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him	38736692362709.93
  —Good Christ! says Alf	19289197.73065472
  Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted	3093421354.7658205
 Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus	2.744804169485074e+27
 Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels	6.87069989449969e+45
 Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature	1.0459110376877843e+65
 It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body	7.340966564222261e+38
 Mind C	1385.096241077174

_ It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H	7.1061469830524e+18
  Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction	9.086677093152292e+20
 Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow	762843146791448.9
  —There he is again, says the citizen, staring out	64699718933351.59
  —Who? says I	2545511.2241524775
  —Bloom, says he	3089809.959581237
 He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes	307962901446416.06
  And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again	1.585422202830209e+19
  —Good Christ! says he	23030587.747905206
  And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence:  —Who said Christ is good?  —I beg your parsnips, says Alf	6.942069252232934e+42
  —Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?  —Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off	2.593573030634762e+34
 He’s over all his troubles	1766097.9557852482
  But Bob Doran shouts out of him	193908743.6923098
  —He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam	4.6287435706689504e+17
  Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises	6.427691904811452e+26
 And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there	2.6982202276676304e+16
  The tear is bloody near your eye	221812582.22694892
 Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour	4.1953862340013234e+72
  —The noblest, the truest, says he	52784368298.13392
 And he’s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam	29813339420390.26
  —Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen	1.0484576301720323e+17
  So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there	7.542681985959271e+20
  —O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters	9463546111029650.0

 Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith	162280925.45551905

_  The citizen made a grab at the letter	36944798818.03317
_  _H	19971.63253487165
_   —And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen	1.6316168808994076e+16
  —And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe	7442464255172.613
 Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf	6.9107012488181336e+16
 Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake	22608933359.5388
  —Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe	572366455951477.6
  —They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses	1.3968072189224918e+27
  And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull	1.7382662752132842e+44
 Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord	1.5187436865301424e+36
  So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on	5.4889678446946476e+69
  —The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf	5608837029624.842
  —That so? says Joe	25732817.555229202
 I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible	1.2890709123836941e+21
 He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker	6.1172718993998206e+22
  —Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said	549274122783370.3
  —That can be explained by science, says Bloom	313868848074.5764
 It’s only a natural phenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the	5.933256126272509e+16
	13.951045332398436
  And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon	8.433219157108205e+19
_  So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other	5.874950317600951e+78
 Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought	3.899301588465927e+17
 Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs	6287804381706793.0
 And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get	5.519677332682062e+22
 So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:  —Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!  Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip	inf
 Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel	239454653242.97824
 And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face	1.2383279457206997e+19
 Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley	9.518737644972543e+21
 Phenomenon!  —The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom	2.3622944902023515e+22
  —You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom	29490606593.46469
	13.951045332398436
  —_Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen	33423676630.35653
 _Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us	6.787358742337884e+22
 From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance	1.1673805299346264e+38
 A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons	3.0043396802810184e+32
 A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse	1.0831181417460467e+57
 Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth-provoking fashion	2.3042804607364978e+29
 Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies	3.877770306611535e+40
 The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat	6.212605757482913e+59
 The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite	9.123061437222814e+43
 The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y	1.5224603440783359e+69

 All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness	1.2196958047852144e+27
 O	146.69219747708274

, several of whom were bleeding profusely	267930416.92664382
 Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses	3.072093107657906e+56
  Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_	4.958960807130922e+26
 The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi	1.851851505022424e+53
 As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office	7.819813664623893e+45
 On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim	inf
 The housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution	4.3264090998072477e+26
 The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_	1.1407927702361553e+20
 She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park	1.4043876909496052e+56
 That monster audience simply rocked with delight	181788973.97269955
 Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage	4.465762512545028e+43
 A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot	3.0443677872157763e+61
 With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:  —God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart	1.1511428458337146e+55
 Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way	1.9513039565160092e+34
  So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland	4.190328714542849e+76
 Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint	1.0733589502319063e+30
 Ireland sober is Ireland free	1427433.266955868
 I’d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog	4.444142980270902e+16
 Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him	4393969398995410.5
 But he might take my leg for a lamppost	36890494982.63488
  So he calls the old dog over	253491232.00138885
  —What’s on you, Garry? says he	37640133608.738014
  Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera	3.937249081673272e+31
 Such growling you never heard as they let off between them	2100359610510.9817
 Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that	3.73984332140035e+33
 Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws	2.9363328645424246e+24
  All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry	9.719962642374027e+69
 The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse	9.559269456765089e+32
 We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D	3.756423482023567e+41

 We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication	1.844266934241159e+44
 The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught	2.2635796895166034e+42
 Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour	8.779042144953937e+28
       The curse of my curses      Seven days every day      And seven dry Thursdays      On you, Barney Kiernan,      Has no sup of water      To cool my courage,      And my guts red roaring      After Lowry’s lights	6.082637114177319e+39
  So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off	1.6804820507555596e+27
  —I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there’s no ill feeling	1.7042974561608896e+20
 Entertainment for man and beast	1732735.881774468
 And says Joe:  —Could you make a hole in another pint?  —Could a swim duck? says I	8.754519640803711e+23
  —Same again, Terry, says Joe	3172649545.651937
  —Thank you, no, says Bloom	4112587882.490777
 As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam’s	7.124914653463508e+24
 Martin asked me to go to the house	3119287127.477719
  —Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is landed	5.390749889764206e+19
 So the wife comes out top dog, what?  —Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers	2.453667533793985e+26
  —Whose admirers? says Joe	18143403.267237414
 He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court	1.3869709037607233e+28
 Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery	130775749711263.67
 True as you’re there	155231.7036493886
 O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery	782587320523260.9
  So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her	8.652813615723822e+59
 Choking with bloody foolery	203593.38389132544
 And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that	4467746644188.084
 Shake hands, brother	175448.2487369339
 You’re a rogue and I’m another	19339126.575118568
 But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness	2.3088893725569173e+24
  —Then suffer me to take your hand, said he	4079503917046.5947
  And off with him and out trying to walk straight	322060367610.7278

O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael	inf

 Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea	inf

 He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words	2.469996924203344e+28
 Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin	5.553116456370923e+20
  And baby prattled after her:  —A jink a jink a jawbo	764120294523384.6
  Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on	8.322681336367577e+58

 None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey	693147228367685.9
 A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme	1.4220956190161883e+37
  But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky	3547652422953421.0
 Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule	2.1785645531773416e+16
 The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had	3.806475397823598e+41
 But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too	5.498906942004347e+57
 Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends	8.639479503378962e+17
 Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition	6.324053722277532e+49
  —Nasty bold Jacky! she cried	164015553.60273865

  But who was Gerty?  Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see	3.128586078232162e+46
 She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell	1.5284861968161513e+26
 The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid’s bow, Greekly perfect	3.050844350338096e+27
 Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either	4.935370710077444e+44
 Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again	3.3263085966937603e+71
 No	152.29096525086916
 Honour where honour is due	1402582.1261516723
 Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist	1.5636882467675297e+47
 Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive	370819807465.6085
 Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one	1.26485785864097e+37
 But Gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair	161200648162.6697
 It was dark brown with a natural wave in it	298447080125.056
 She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth	4.01773238388897e+37
 And just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal	1.241472650217549e+47
 Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent	365110504509525.8
 The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning	3.306374559347395e+32
 As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window	1.228290536337059e+33
 Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W	9.965746769242433e+48
 E	136.572860520901
 Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core	1.887520698649495e+24
 Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time	3930526200826857.5
  Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out	2.405528981522163e+31
 A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady’s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection	inf
 She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone	2.9370973218626694e+34
 All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny	1.9365810051965584e+44
 She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew	2.3042580012798958e+61
 Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep	3.946708937329944e+57
 Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops	9.242957879482393e+34
 As for undies they were Gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things	inf
 She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a Friday	inf
  And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time	1.0829550805555159e+22
 Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror	1.3800963916622446e+57
 You are lovely, Gerty, it said	3709868467.7201114
 Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T	1.4857208801639933e+29
 C	138.9578885370511
 (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be	1.1967725016492312e+40
 He was too young to understand	22599010.10730832
 He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments	1.4695178702783034e+44
 Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men	6.592886286736697e+29
 But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over	5.900160239960943e+20
 For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve	291049156590.79285
 With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward	7.89218301074815e+40
 Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November	3.0242803441401584e+33
 She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess	9.540437956504782e+26
 Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses	inf
  Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight	3.918575110905466e+43
 The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies	2.1501216829834684e+24
 It’s my ball	14566.395533385908
  But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day	2.877401828743637e+42
  —Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss	25464238377.48474
  And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin	1.973539904357026e+41
  —I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t say	1.040951036958596e+21
  —On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily	3921061623.5074263
  Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said	8.596487783051927e+52
 You had to laugh at her sometimes	226328301.43801123
 For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White	2.0168418554671334e+64
 That was just like Cissycums	2765963.976350496
 O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette	1.3880662580072808e+35
 It was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S	8.254887627623475e+17
 J	143.8452884389744
 How sad to poor Gerty’s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none	7.008394121717676e+48
 But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days	3.88913329118877e+21
 Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low	2.517266432162337e+79
 And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk	4.376877423632126e+47
 You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose	5.697899040529457e+66
 Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke	1.8978972048670616e+80
 And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff	5.968595705313202e+48
 Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways	254070865600.96323
 You could see there was a story behind it	29064549161.575687
 She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant	5.407225021027649e+59
  The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks	2.593445558769002e+46
 Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please	1.3494285929564545e+27
 The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed	3.7852125618275417e+53
 A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle	5.49292308552311e+57
 She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks	5.839644354882629e+21
 And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her	inf
  The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers	2.593714255037222e+20
 Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air	1.9425642992046164e+18
 Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa	7.572379327395169e+49
  —Say papa, baby	1990657.7905621233
 Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa	948414318.474331
  —Haja ja ja haja	1109698.0956873079
  Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him	6.516117853903863e+53
  And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks	2711031925785.311
 It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased	1.263440162825868e+53
 It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft	3.2761507904010082e+72
 And while she gazed her heart went pitapat	2908513047.4887233
 Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look	1.0598607380798517e+19
 His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul	4.442570750978357e+20
 She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting	inf
 He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face	2.176658970628026e+25
 She would have given worlds to know what it was	272510016880.2138
 He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down	2.802418441853099e+42
 She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away	4.680064560918565e+25
 It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else	1.0956193914496918e+28
 Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her	4.0785242863629615e+19
 There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm	2312658225.098645
 Comfortress of the afflicted	283323.9653049107
 _Ora pro nobis_	1514146.7557698735
 Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart	1.311748078044116e+47
 He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic	9.780750224192581e+50
 He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word	inf
  The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it	1.4682895024024028e+27
 Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them	1.0188711993604154e+26
 She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it	1.6172519013292653e+69
 It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble	9.227647122770098e+36
  Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_	inf
 She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve	5.278216344705251e+21
 She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes	3.0121641336847386e+34
 He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey	216625331249.12448
 Her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose	1.2590435883627506e+38
  Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby	1.0388919061249575e+31
 And she said to Gerty:  —A penny for your thoughts	46887605822236.42
  —What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth	5455006643652930.0
 And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again	2.7088000199658543e+34
  —Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum	7.806014524908421e+21
  So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church	3.8397002867095206e+40
 Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself	5.290017036588339e+16
 One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure	7.012233088857349e+38
 His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones	4.729927247808286e+28
 Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order	7.885428178135728e+21
  Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O’Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time	inf
 She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon	1.3395241480656448e+52
 His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine	1.0114151483277405e+21
 It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it	61390051551094.78
  Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over	inf
 Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of	2.022029024320236e+40
 She had loved him better than he knew	2044398877.4784324
 Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears	6.7469568421364e+35
  —O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up	6.605872361870435e+19
 I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year	221104790858699.97
 There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with	1.3335955290313466e+22
 And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot	1.4438279251400923e+28
 He has his bib destroyed	2518507.140621396
  The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights	5.5272597424228205e+20
  How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry	4.292362142987463e+52
 And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales	inf
 For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of	23111105088.971397
 She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean	3.9134885091208293e+58
 _Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it	inf

 There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind	2.0899234811128213e+56
 But even if—what then? Would it make a very great difference? From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled	1.6841453938059797e+26
 She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station	9.726374365182684e+46
 Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall	3.9213253318390784e+17

 Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free	4672460729911.903
  Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:  —O, look, Cissy!

 She had no intention of being at their beck and call	2560626611388.653
 Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his	1.2425063561913403e+21
 She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed	inf

 Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl	1.582681630313673e+32
 He was leaning back against the rock behind	2242137613.8507442
 What a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered	7.481911480012294e+74

 Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat	271944504646036.72
 Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night? Bad policy however to fault the husband	4.8504290880414555e+20
 They stick by one another like glue	170718977.00587887
 Maybe the women’s fault also	1433875.7365769811

Universally that person’s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind’s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature’s incorrupted benefaction	inf

  And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat	1.7010037164445553e+28
 And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon	4344408658438071.5
 And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice	inf
 And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there	1.0417980828963239e+23
 And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile	3.1373416862440013e+22
 Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility	5.180993897524698e+29
 And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery	1.1013025996013948e+31
  And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment	1.2592099659743308e+36

 And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead	4.458809445896436e+34

 And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case)	1.628192364785561e+80
 And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die	3.148671563872588e+47

 Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever	4.5608480900803964e+47
 He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded	3.1786832834717006e+73
 That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word	2.3612422288320686e+20
 Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons	7.248145947557066e+47
  About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray	4.0279745780816883e+68

 He’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s Irish, says he	9.548342260682046e+21
 Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop	1.5500581164168312e+29
 It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose	2.404607460197332e+31
 True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock	3.3421689420118983e+39
 He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains	1.853697935534312e+45
 So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly	4.3655627716748336e+36
 Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content	inf

 And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders	2.723553433142867e+67
 There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in his matters, says he	2.341735645805825e+50
 But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show	inf
 After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name	3.5959749487474163e+37
 They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America	inf

 Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired	7.060326260774122e+77
 It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep	inf

 Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck	inf

 For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a bastard	3.8882187569358894e+58
 This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight	2.176170253690507e+27
 The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber	2.656083094003879e+21
  Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it	inf

 It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable	inf
 To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat	inf
