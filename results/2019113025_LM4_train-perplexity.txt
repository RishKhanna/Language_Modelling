  Title: Ulysses  Author: James Joyce  Release Date: December 27, 2001 [eBook #4300] [Most recently updated: December 27, 2019]  Language: English  Character set encoding: UTF-8  Produced by: Col Choat and David Widger  *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ULYSSES ***  [Illustration]     Ulysses   by James Joyce   Contents   — I —   [ 1 ]  [ 2 ]  [ 3 ]   — II —   [ 4 ]  [ 5 ]  [ 6 ]  [ 7 ]  [ 8 ]  [ 9 ]  [ 10 ]  [ 11 ]  [ 12 ]  [ 13 ]  [ 14 ]  [ 15 ]   — III —   [ 16 ]  [ 17 ]  [ 18 ]     — I —   [ 1 ]  Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed1.801526783555277e+19
 A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air6273.292369394014
 He held the bowl aloft and intoned:  —_Introibo ad altare Dei_7991.78826884949
  Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:  —Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!  Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest3401617.1714162384
 He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains4686.6092840463325
 Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head1647861.2293450024
 Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak45683816.74390182
  Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly2514.4139375483774
  —Back to barracks! he said sternly2205.3316009069977
  He added in a preacher’s tone:  —For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns236020.76898396725
 Slow music, please357.3590608787226
 Shut your eyes, gents315.1849285030567
 A little trouble about those white corpuscles514.5003620532515
 Silence, all300.02900943321094
  He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points436194.01278329775
 Chrysostomos169.55983776003015
 Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm564.0982904723809
  —Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly2210.742499065805
 That will do nicely365.70117166412433
 Switch off the current, will you?  He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown616479.0196976823
 The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages10649.128498494774
 A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips581.5712505684775
  —The mockery of it! he said gaily3261.4178509808903
 Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!  He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself375391.95558098104
 Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck17500606.543733515
  Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on415.12618424486294
  —My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls5194.258797499103
 But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn’t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself3801.330276295756
 We must go to Athens392.88662968043343
 Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?  He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:  —Will he come? The jejune jesuit!  Ceasing, he began to shave with care273732638.37903607
  —Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly15362.699387626535
  —Yes, my love?  —How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?  Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder691623.5162117061
  —God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly3819.809761377647
 A ponderous Saxon232.04759276196063
 He thinks you’re not a gentleman472.79366360967236
 God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion1349.2868851241362
 Because he comes from Oxford581.0889817324631
 You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner21553.45466074785
 He can’t make you out464.44879297025113
 O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade34159.37782805294
  He shaved warily over his chin423.8816933871801
  —He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said4147.861225816604
 Where is his guncase?  —A woful lunatic! Mulligan said2083.4811085106976
 Were you in a funk?  —I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear532919.0245553368
 Out here in the dark with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther326045.20981283084
 You saved men from drowning380.6392276102215
 I’m not a hero, however853.9490038831711
 If he stays on here I am off927.2719876879954
  Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade1339.5894502589106
 He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily2754.1682205265997
  —Scutter! he cried thickly722.6157230684722
  He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper pocket, said:  —Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor1709853.9492353268
  Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief19696.58218178822
 Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly309.57578324880643
 Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:  —The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen4575701.710278487
 You can almost taste it, can’t you?  He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly464932.75707621797
  —God! he said quietly1499.4511122468073
 Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother? The snotgreen sea7351.919148439694
 The scrotumtightening sea201.05371647877138
 _Epi oinopa ponton_361.4255576554653
 Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you3358.152600305629
 You must read them in the original1914.9409446233087
 _Thalatta! Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother4774.893508850379
 Come and look277.39992732769605
  Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet5539.489201606719
 Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown411695.6946447047
  —Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said835.6027084292846
  He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s face6008.485641441412
  —The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said1431.5619876760009
  —Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily4569.9741377862
  —You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said96347.45162689323
 I’m hyperborean as much as you1205.6333097374004
 But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her94583.19177308294
 And you refused219.29541375870076
 There is something sinister in you421.4682989342113
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
  He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek738.2809611419788
 A tolerant smile curled his lips329.20312698258925
  —But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself1166.0214151823955
  Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve237942.3423806236
 Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart29497.367858867583
 Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes53705308.097035654
 Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him50855.32545080336
 The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid2711.0244278103364
 A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting128975.76758071812
  Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade341.83655830476
  —Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice16070.894319155486
 I must give you a shirt and a few noserags4291.5043498182795
 How are the secondhand breeks?  —They fit well enough, Stephen answered6078.403141776933
  Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip549.600158357972
  —The mockery of it, he said contentedly17413.302403560647
 Secondleg they should be326.68072492756517
 God knows what poxy bowsy left them off730.9055189616823
 I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey1725.2804021186319
 You’ll look spiffing in them327.13111856766625
 I’m not joking, Kinch308.30523467362406
 You look damn well when you’re dressed580.2267334644814
  —Thanks, Stephen said373.5859532999671
 I can’t wear them if they are grey1486.7703824237517
  —He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror59131.74908862795
 Etiquette is etiquette222.96389989396766
 He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers1591.456922179126
  He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin1824.345170400436
  Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes89695.58872067371
  —That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g194462.9910495595
 p22.3816255164593
 i39.41616843965535
 He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman389.5374998951057
 General paralysis of the insane!  He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea149099.07505082196
 His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth2259.227871985077
 Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk441.7212857083197
  —Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!  Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack17706271.02885714
 Hair on end293.63772523924575
 As he and others see me811.0066118141805
 Who chose this face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin2829.9138411667773
 It asks me too280.01059901528987
  —I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said20119.523766811682
 It does her all right365.62965812081256
 The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi444.10714900175986
 Lead him not into temptation371.81223013709456
 And her name is Ursula601.2982682594097
  Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes7820.164046812942
  —The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said8660.430037845823
 If Wilde were only alive to see you!  Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:  —It is a symbol of Irish art6059347.851991609
 The cracked lookingglass of a servant373.803561369342
  Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them368238.6374535241
  —It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly1115820.6722563813
 God knows you have more spirit than any of them1684.3380169539955
  Parried again182.4709478362761
 He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his2784.1444312832896
 The cold steel pen377.7892010898202
  —Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea46491.02893151429
 He’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman1278.950850939602
 His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other5681.14724149929
 God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island415261.18206611107
 Hellenise it186.41056284633268
  Cranly’s arm174.07507120235923
 His arm187.92514240861527
  —And to think of your having to beg from these swine5991.87134353483
 I’m the only one that knows what you are1784.4450264199422
 Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe18132527.515517216
  Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms454.67878565764556
 Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another1426.0387356594035
 O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor’s shears31555988.04408417
 A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade344.80245916926384
 I don’t want to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!  Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle206729.52052463283
 A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms7365.049253046094
  To ourselves188.53110008735143

 omphalos171.9802797411953
  —Let him stay, Stephen said608.9195259617759
 There’s nothing wrong with him except at night1171.7989965589786
  —Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently9909.028560131725
 I’m quite frank with you329.3535494428122
 What have you against me now?  They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale1179226.0171954832
 Stephen freed his arm quietly320.7743486343436
  —Do you wish me to tell you? he asked9268.12654185539
  —Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered12539.04869140295
 I don’t remember anything297.70646940388343
 A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes20723.559500303014
  Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:  —Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s death?  Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:  —What? Where? I can’t remember anything68058348302.80894
 I remember only ideas and sensations363.0847269400988
 Why? What happened in the name of God?  —You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water15690686.166633058
 Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom15756.325915588443
 She asked you who was in your room2168.9859342587324
  —Yes? Buck Mulligan said506.356261281777
 What did I say? I forget1678.5294537611985
  —You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead63040.67202744989
_  A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan’s cheek3993.5574879816363
  —Did I say that? he asked3072.924686081844
 Well? What harm is that?  He shook his constraint from him nervously15232.465822137956
  —And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You saw only your mother die116336.20443495826
 I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom21002.6872644259
 It’s a beastly thing and nothing else580.4208277178345
 It simply doesn’t matter306.4405039694051
 You wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you16447.178640607657
 Why? Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected the wrong way20510.911935857912
 To me it’s all a mockery and beastly994.9537895235928
 Her cerebral lobes are not functioning379.9156295427013
 She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt1418.9314034973354
 Humour her till it’s over345.1124302868797
 You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette’s13410.660059389975
 Absurd! I suppose I did say it1785.1045037186232
 I didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother2827.6777470003817
  He had spoken himself into boldness345.1246481713719
 Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:  —I am not thinking of the offence to my mother7600502.10290634
  —Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked1756.715784131184
  —Of the offence to me, Stephen answered3882.9397405155805
  Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel535.8579017091681
  —O, an impossible person! he exclaimed1119.2440076874066
  He walked off quickly round the parapet487.13872400815654
 Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland3094.444658747305
 Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks322641.29481337994
  A voice within the tower called loudly:  —Are you up there, Mulligan?  —I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered837311.5409211358
  He turned towards Stephen and said:  —Look at the sea33971.185026460254
 What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down8653.532912582164
 The Sassenach wants his morning rashers304.4370836097266
  His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof:  —Don’t mope over it all day, he said7685479.358031084
 I’m inconsequent181.92676836932273
 Give up the moody brooding320.10648903430183
  His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead:       And no more turn aside and brood      Upon love’s bitter mystery      For Fergus rules the brazen cars1498010.6866501302
  Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed3774.817318946853
 Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet2902.422751652685
 White breast of the dim sea470.1045507975779
 The twining stresses, two by two512.554198617192
 Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide523.087077749786
  A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green3761.3772439725963
 It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters3650.896050365042
 Fergus’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords55717.52366908965
 Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music3450.5025331268876
 Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside3358.2447817216485
 She was crying in her wretched bed510.4696302481128
 For those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery1740.3854751153162
  Where now?  Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer6913.7870046520275
 A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl58207.99893101726
 She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:       I am the boy      That can enjoy      Invisibility565427.3433531446
  Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed474.15916089625927
       And no more turn aside and brood288.3203561205516
   Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys4143.958025834141
 Memories beset his brooding brain265.8422676206202
 Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament8955.388977644065
 A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening12350.858475293013
 Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts2943.1414592328847
  In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes30726260.043689273
  Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul8339.169812726628
 On me alone271.89891191687934
 The ghostcandle to light her agony343.9032934288929
 Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees3769.4119398006187
 Her eyes on me to strike me down1752.1999796476869
 _Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat969.1195934839224
_  Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!  No, mother! Let me be and let me live33475.22558320694
  —Kinch ahoy!  Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower3247.9867553230893
 It came nearer up the staircase, calling again2545.079158608372
 Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words153377.16578024844
  —Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey7582.821532918609
 Breakfast is ready216.5063952564503
 Haines is apologising for waking us last night481.81911437199
 It’s all right114.18874004506016
  —I’m coming, Stephen said, turning7019.500193154817
  —Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said1722.0710392170292
 For my sake and for all our sakes1662.1180403983653
  —I told him your symbol of Irish art1585.8799842796961
 He says it’s very clever339.82716217050347
  —I get paid this morning, Stephen said1821.0925288454298
  —The school kip? Buck Mulligan said748.1974229807468
 How much? Four quid? Lend us one1023.0659221239046
  —If you want it, Stephen said1327.8564437303614
  —Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight3011.048990972217
 We’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids754.0657096762873
 Four omnipotent sovereigns207.42730880647957
  He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent:       O, won’t we have a merry time,      Drinking whisky, beer and wine!      On coronation,      Coronation day!      O, won’t we have a merry time      On coronation day!  Warm sunshine merrying over the sea1327348222.4250844
 The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet4396.607824613399
 Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?  He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck1414798597.0866334
 So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes1143.760425632016
 I am another now and yet the same834.0349396358773
 A servant too247.32387830828537
 A server of a servant486.71343174156766
 Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning670719.4586984492
  —We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said503.4598339703895
 Haines, open that door, will you?  Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker19192.391445281217
 A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors424579.7331391856
  —Have you the key? a voice asked3698.66938973288
  —Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said1400.337366091887
 Janey Mack, I’m choked!  He howled, without looking up from the fire:  —Kinch!  —It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward18891428.07605919
  The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered87349.64536048209
 Haines stood at the doorway, looking out2677.1624824019536
 Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait20420.83993178309
 Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him5765.050874546854
 Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief631569.0857987616
  —I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when67503.26228613658
5.498166464669896
 But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey64507.92426557979
 Haines, come in328.63385083592914
 The grub is ready230.7548733853544
 Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts3527.2080241142507
 Where’s the sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk4302.48160470923
  Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker4064.093303914
 Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet1363.2954873715876
  —What sort of a kip is this? he said7178.641388426199
  —We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily6382.975051253488
 There’s a lemon in the locker414.94856032126336
  —O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said2056.161902233132
 I want Sandycove milk229.41802968791734
  Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:  —That woman is coming up with the milk409037.58203460876
 Sit down197.5583689720084
 Pour out the tea there476.42775090997173
 The sugar is in the bag2055.308661455814
 Here, I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs1333.2943753920695
  He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying:  —_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti997595.5709780499
_  Haines sat down to pour out the tea2630.4688334776592
  —I’m giving you two lumps each, he said1247.3550721181125
 But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don’t you?  Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s wheedling voice:  —When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said15623105749.1148
 And when I makes water I makes water1608.9637444668906
  —By Jove, it is tea, Haines said6302.886752304396
  Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:  —_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she180803.42502268215
 _Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don’t make them in the one pot527370.7709655993
  —That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines61900.64916360704
 Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum3153.5908978060447
 Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind8845.753608995738
  He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows:  —Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?  —I doubt it, said Stephen gravely3232015877.873534
  —Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone80155.61416426452
 Your reasons, pray?  —I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion19273687.14808783
 Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann2540.5313831110793
  —Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly49529.53529717679
 Do you think she was? Quite charming!  Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:  _—For old Mary Ann  She doesn’t care a damn14940401.845833918
  But, hising up her petticoats367.6241947405845
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
_  He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned1289.8032985779053
  The doorway was darkened by an entering form579.1298557827491
  —The milk, sir!  —Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said39255.69065344418
 Kinch, get the jug534.0381856735124
  An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow5328.8365713416015
 Glory be to God281.01894157618
  —To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her7373.464489562509
 Ah, to be sure!  Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker15532.68844093019
  —The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces13927.724995227794
  —How much, sir? asked the old woman14748.93521758737
  —A quart, Stephen said732.1162263894131
  He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers4738.092010169847
 She poured again a measureful and a tilly549.00669067306
 She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out2466.884190223914
 Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs17598.711924655843
 They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle1278.79881309344
 Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times11057.654221988423
 A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning18487.92446503504
 To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour11605.546848781814
  —It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups21829.163561279565
  —Taste it, sir, she said3380.941396423224
  He drank at her bidding343.155371706882
  —If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts9095614.22883576
 Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits4427.656448283041
  —Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked16473.33876057091
  —I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered4137.277827602021
  —Look at that now, she said2075.894925669893
  Stephen listened in scornful silence282.62077477537247
 She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights25388.250794613446
 To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey647607.362795596
 And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes5093.117877937044
  —Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her5096.273666787316
  —Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines48138.30745040393
  Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently2460.387704189907
  —Irish, Buck Mulligan said447.8668987664936
 Is there Gaelic on you?  —I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it56874034.464257
 Are you from the west, sir?  —I am an Englishman, Haines answered754572.349488751
  —He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland494225.7474363748
  —Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the language myself881901.305849603
 I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows1392.8353552164956
  —Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan3346.362184590259
 Wonderful entirely194.43246238518557
 Fill us out some more tea, Kinch870.2511937895127
 Would you like a cup, ma’am?  —No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go466152488.0666845
  Haines said to her:  —Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?  Stephen filled again the three cups3409499.646635175
  —Bill, sir? she said, halting14093.527315667397
 Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling193404.92621813432
 That’s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir13936.833086305523
  Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets403046.22657921514
  —Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling62101.03769765935
  Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk3424.555333558143
 Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried:  —A miracle!  He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:  —Ask nothing more of me, sweet1341456827.0796642
 All I can give you I give2162.57020496421
  Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand855.3550921261591
  —We’ll owe twopence, he said463.8926451887765
  —Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin82081.26595802708
 Good morning, sir302.24243526062344
  She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:  _—Heart of my heart, were it more,  More would be laid at your feet6080872.669181046
_  He turned to Stephen and said:  —Seriously, Dedalus13450.104285588222
 I’m stony186.23909479877008
 Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money2246.3390183999113
 Today the bards must drink and junket484.8252474556383
 Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty1584.4712586386163
  —That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today422509.36603114795
  —Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said583.3660825892034
  He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:  —Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?  Then he said to Haines:  —The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month116959079.03437659
  —All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf119243.22724900553
  Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:  —I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me20591248.1536416
  Speaking to me317.7946049425863
 They wash and tub and scrub357.3988117981313
 Agenbite of inwit117.29409306701518
 Conscience171.40042574091876
 Yet here’s a spot288.2918150215625
  —That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good14317.781460282858
  Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone:  —Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines782565.3293315438
  —Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen74197.32713567471
 I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in7775.136691987716
  —Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked1484.094014269753
  Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said:  —I don’t know, I’m sure60327288.82190088
  He strolled out to the doorway1173.8686546428657
 Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour:  —You put your hoof in it now130386.78486333048
 What did you say that for?  —Well? Stephen said27492.64375987867
 From whom? From the milkwoman or from him956.2727951894249
 It’s a toss up, I think958.9872765561962
  —I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes2218609.8367529362
  —I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him20809.499968278866
  Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm3077.643006693532
  —From me, Kinch, he said4620.41816654675
  In a suddenly changed tone he added:  —To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right126213.70382604239
 Damn all else they are good for963.9817459613025
 Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all18898.704964280605
 Let us get out of the kip7679.992515060452
  He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly:  —Mulligan is stripped of his garments49509.565098643594
  He emptied his pockets on to the table1510.066159355279
  —There’s your snotrag, he said610.2389753453931
 His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief3056.59677808358
 God, we’ll simply have to dress the character884.8714304176831
 I want puce gloves and green boots413.2435791719284
 Contradiction169.55983776003015
 Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself3750.5157978381426
 Mercurial Malachi205.52495921882195
 A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands3996.8939685057553
  —And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said1773.8635887820633
  Stephen picked it up and put it on4296.86348929874
 Haines called to them from the doorway:  —Are you coming, you fellows?  —I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door8013534.134455793
 Come out, Kinch355.6502980509573
 You have eaten all we left, I suppose938.0350249348588
 Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:  —And going forth he met Butterly117665.61331776745
  Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it3477609.213765223
 He put the huge key in his inner pocket1199.0753506133474
  At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:  —Did you bring the key?  —I have it, Stephen said, preceding them380676922.7331253
  He walked on163.43689918128644
 Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses5345.161470730566
  —Down, sir! How dare you, sir!  Haines asked:  —Do you pay rent for this tower?  —Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said9486251.21667595
  —To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder3307.5617404928503
  They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:  —Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say21315.477762414906
 Martello you call it?  —Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea4267734.955514236
 But ours is the _omphalos_568.3373007254082
  —What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen2385.6061653947722
  —No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain11541.09277632937
 I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up5739.5602844141995
 Wait till I have a few pints in me first5615.291480312265
  He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat:  —You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?  —It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer34685392617.680244
  —You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably1379.0557464948095
 Is it some paradox?  —Pooh! Buck Mulligan said1183.894357802163
 We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes586.159965156761
 It’s quite simple210.0617559373772
 He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father44760.77239080407
  —What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen9625.580225175303
 He himself?  Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:  —O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!  —We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines39569907745.786156
 And it is rather long to tell1271.3473538890012
  Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands4092.416911058859
  —The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said2026.0150108627067
  —I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore174022.20619058397
 _That beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?  Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak3004637.5936719524
 In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires5971.732083336223
  —It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again9866.164403038923
  Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent3920.236415766921
 The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins158420.4613704757
  —I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused23841.57232443238
 The Son striving to be atoned with the Father977.8428211903613
  Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face1068.6468611828286
 He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety2290790.5209740005
 He moved a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:  _—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard27588075.47061198
 My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird2547.564703358624
 With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree616.6693377802875
 So here’s to disciples and Calvary311.6898548788322
_  He held up a forefinger of warning1207.7274270441726
  _—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again375725.4282227958
_  He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:  _—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead85481460305.73778
 What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet’s breezy1612.4277901280034
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
 Goodbye, now, goodbye!_  He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries2434012.5411517504
  Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said:  —We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose724964.4633372251
 He’s rather blasphemous198.07954568289847
 I’m not a believer myself, that is to say4996.54956279432
 Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?  —The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered25922407.877581075
  —O, Haines said, you have heard it before?  —Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily10768161.582934534
  —You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked12252.01102674805
 I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word4817.702471531618
 Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God638.3370857461609
  —There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said65411.168227992006
  Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone3325.382860154749
 He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it2336.910287877825
  —Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette16029.754242690366
  Haines helped himself and snapped the case to992.6082888662357
 He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands35259221.50405751
  —Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again579959.3335157826
 Either you believe or you don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal God25250.518294106245
 You don’t stand for that, I suppose?  —You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought14226584.680732453
  He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side15688.83434698263
 Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels3385.018720772203
 My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path5622.872562795056
 They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark4387.101858110434
 He wants that key286.30878482660785
 It is mine235.4210019783683
 I paid the rent277.6731627409248
 Now I eat his salt bread387.42164660486014
 Give him the key too895.9943313995558
 All92.57163803248217
 He will ask for it394.48240288327673
 That was in his eyes1347.9409401866105
  —After all, Haines began602.5192568543168
5.498166464669896
  —After all, I should think you are able to free yourself5814.784812630857
 You are your own master, it seems to me2605.7245103993705
  —I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian112077.84388024488
  —Italian? Haines said263.10689659573126
  A crazy queen, old and jealous610.5153472243557
 Kneel down before me337.2280934599372
  —And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs66803.45162991017
  —Italian? Haines said again384.56493329972204
 What do you mean?  —The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church7443578.716522609
  Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke1600.3202123941996
  —I can quite understand that, he said calmly14510.063058593229
 An Irishman must think like that, I daresay6490.445069003149
 We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly1370.263670549973
 It seems history is to blame342.53275306594287
  The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars757251.9895026132
 Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs711349.5474545452
 A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son1339106042.5251722
 Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger3102.837731827345
 Idle mockery197.0040026763962
 The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields12114998.47984697
  Hear, hear! Prolonged applause589.2735334744574
 _Zut! Nom de Dieu!_  —Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one932153.9473063888
 I don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either13092.371200646645
 That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now1376.9579425036663
  Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman7150.689134905597
  —She’s making for Bullock harbour341.6268189829966
  The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain2884.03905095763
  —There’s five fathoms out there, he said2089.7627825301515
 It’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one4304.709668472058
 It’s nine days today260.2905984912399
  The man that was drowned524.1833516347151
 A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite125496.4807250715
 Here I am332.16660748835653
  They followed the winding path down to the creek2921.9790630625957
 Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder13232.749627241179
 A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water71229.70052165473
  —Is the brother with you, Malachi?  —Down in Westmeath6585.072758967303
 With the Bannons163.7333326249863
  —Still there? I got a card from Bannon1762.214503663882
 Says he found a sweet young thing down there1104.224476682348
 Photo girl he calls her393.07197918988254
  —Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure1539.954089157052
  Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots941.7270410333209
 An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face4298.533809006539
  Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone857367.7764920729
  —Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock35888.47646633749
 Chucked medicine and going in for the army1239.5224766074007
  —Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said1697.3627760546822
  —Going over next week to stew394.3739417511388
 You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?  —Yes4403.3465809734835
  —Spooning with him last night on the pier1683.04733803951
 The father is rotto with money456.482961654134
  —Is she up the pole?  —Better ask Seymour that1650.464896116284
  —Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said557.2784095069793
  He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely:  —Redheaded women buck like goats97331.69171954883
  He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt2815.560795939924
  —My twelfth rib is gone, he cried1509.1845672886675
 I’m the _Übermensch272.9894153723218
_ Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen965.9595217822407
  He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay42502.91350373865
  —Are you going in here, Malachi?  —Yes4958.078409692413
 Make room in the bed609.6745687108552
  The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes106719.20731866141
 Haines sat down on a stone, smoking4658.138426625691
  —Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked4507.36121355292
  —Later on, Haines said889.2811079398859
 Not on my breakfast297.1119027426329
  Stephen turned away235.15443510656084
  —Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat348377.1826648221
  Stephen handed him the key843.7052380546045
 Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes549.464964501365
  —And twopence, he said, for a pint25662.91982505211
 Throw it there293.465580779716
  Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap886.604740346329
 Dressing, undressing221.7677282391803
 Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:  —He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord75162.02270626459
 Thus spake Zarathustra206.14333870902624
  His plump body plunged248.50049026345448
  —We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish78574.83472844132
  Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon7207.443235072493
  —The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried2298.0946854850527
 Half twelve182.26242927523705
  —Good, Stephen said418.6915785733783
  He walked along the upwardcurving path339.1546866019099
      Turma circumdet118.92880866470648
      Iubilantium te virginum106.82451556649058
  The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly850.133634068839
 I will not sleep here tonight456.73992772229803
 Home also I cannot go393.1683547690355
  A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea22807.039191317297
 Turning the curve he waved his hand546.377069904831
 It called again205.90604835666434
 A sleek brown head, a seal’s, far out on the water, round41112.53933990843
  Usurper163.44048197260335
     [ 2 ]   —You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?  —Tarentum, sir20270.75491762203
  —Very good142.94898782666138
 Well?  —There was a battle, sir6703.063823622618
  —Very good142.94898782666138
 Where?  The boy’s blank face asked the blank window1118.1071221029238
  Fabled by the daughters of memory721.3512534709294
 And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it11883.565089694248
 A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings of excess5157.172885957462
 I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame6930.632563047028
 What’s left us then?  —I forget the place, sir12576.08793857018
 279 B171.04131623106048
 C23.414818345807948
  —Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book43222.61713511302
  —Yes, sir61.015732518990326
 And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done for26073.980146897968
_  That phrase the world had remembered498.48225796018636
 A dull ease of the mind428.6883780973019
 From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear4415.580182952704
 Any general to any officers362.70097793723244
 They lend ear210.1448403788533
  —You, Armstrong, Stephen said1254.620312449224
 What was the end of Pyrrhus?  —End of Pyrrhus, sir?  —I know, sir2014252.9581810199
 Ask me, sir, Comyn said3558.991462951317
  —Wait141.6482753405839
 You, Armstrong322.19892275942146
 Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?  A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel4410.502090644588
 He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly1087.1432730833155
 Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips693.0263495917495
 A sweetened boy’s breath241.4711057286264
 Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy8451.743986347843
 Vico Road, Dalkey288.5073658549298
  —Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier3136.479984440127
  All laughed187.1317671005614
 Mirthless high malicious laughter233.92837486944572
 Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile1161.421651332349
 In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay93859.54478395091
  —Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book, what is a pier540844.505566594
  —A pier, sir, Armstrong said4415.335191109282
 A thing out in the water2411.8474850086577
 A kind of a bridge2432.014097067305
 Kingstown pier, sir414.17495008375414
  Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning717.5416965651915
 Two in the back bench whispered1449.116335993724
 Yes35.21241412103726
 They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent1053.7997762324114
 All92.57163803248217
 With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily3295.7934667730256
 Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle5662.71931786664
  —Kingstown pier, Stephen said631.2209738321062
 Yes, a disappointed bridge305.2506508854669
  The words troubled their gaze313.75055036722387
  —How, sir? Comyn asked1823.137196439298
 A bridge is across a river451.75913196392037
  For Haines’s chapbook202.24640972632045
 No-one here to hear335.24400275930907
 Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind5894.561878084173
 What then? A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master’s praise34456.05124118345
 For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop6946.952166652957
  Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death2991.6511135853966
 They are not to be thought away1597.450963624544
 Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted22409.898255090753
 But can those have been possible seeing that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave, weaver of the wind112494.31116424543
  —Tell us a story, sir1053.058684153065
  —O, do, sir890.4993867835003
 A ghoststory205.81044454995555
  —Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book10263.45327828076
  —_Weep no more,_ Comyn said1706.5416540602582
  —Go on then, Talbot441.17888735953466
  —And the story, sir?  —After, Stephen said29053.616822006985
 Go on, Talbot614.0596772420288
  A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel2372.0390990508067
 He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:  _—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor9162655.958908502
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
_  It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible26026.507964842152
 Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night1639057.2111390787
 By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy1368.280873252797
 Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds169486.05078073769
 Thought is the thought of thought676.9314306487177
 Tranquil brightness196.74836176119612
 The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms385756.94913483557
 Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms1162.348242399192
  Talbot repeated:  _—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,  Through the dear might328497.347356671
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
_  —Turn over, Stephen said quietly3185.998719355567
 I don’t see anything343.25637147808135
  —What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward3024.645290813793
  His hand turned the page over532.7422770446899
 He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered7324.174793957884
 Of him that walked the waves635.0643461472857
 Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine14584.231520383093
 It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute3232.2677828288683
 To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s1468.349137147087
 A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church’s looms6524.516382554038
 Ay89.49976950888444
       Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro1192.0314805456464
      My father gave me seeds to sow548.3376623309479
  —Have I heard all? Stephen asked762.5975312070326
  —Yes, sir61.015732518990326
 Hockey at ten, sir331.8198660081356
  —Half day, sir432.18997949612765
 Thursday113.51549008303833
  —Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked702.9884547701539
  They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling680.2720761333087
 Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily:  —A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir131892.22436104357
  —O, ask me, sir488.6744566208589
  —A hard one, sir469.01337946909854
  —This is the riddle, Stephen said:       The cock crew,      The sky was blue:      The bells in heaven      Were striking eleven728274.1847068849
      ’Tis time for this poor soul      To go to heaven6327.270155815415
  What is that?  —What, sir?  —Again, sir54983.307462446704
 We didn’t hear218.39488547188202
  Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated944.1759148581158
 After a silence Cochrane said:  —What is it, sir? We give it up1341048.8313486713
  Stephen, his throat itching, answered:  —The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush44049.12186461481
  He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay14394.877830709798
 Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues27688.970343250483
  Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook2447.9216677834243
 His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading6763.144483107359
 On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail’s bed21791.46669769797
  He held out his copybook517.0072871454215
 The word _Sums_ was written on the headline1250.0358805906453
 Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot19323.105645336364
 Cyril Sargent: his name and seal950.5886537713862
  —Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir2102574.651959018
  Stephen touched the edges of the book1167.8272642010131
 Futility169.55983776003015
  —Do you understand how to do them now? he asked4827.94002329015
  —Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered415.83762456625993
 Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir29605.896432556285
  —Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked2245.032639007567
  —No, sir224.18033467829895
  Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail’s bed9111.757905064731
 Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart60757.92880222893
 She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own1036.7740966359447
 She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been4449.587886581207
 A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped22863375.247371715
  Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem1781.829250378423
 He proves by algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather434.1260915611161
 Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses494.4579157820422
 Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field8969.015272261144
  Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes85842.05682945697
 Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors4044.2104174335627
 Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend16323337.775050947
  —Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?  —Yes, sir19538.255969717793
  In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data400.3641770911165
 _Amor matris:_ subjective and objective genitive491.57814408789284
 With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands5793.425516725746
  Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness1907.4155537318286
 My childhood bends beside me316.30954839808754
 Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly5185.132707264069
 Mine is far and his secret as our eyes1056.65794654802
 Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned232791.47483745829
  The sum was done316.8355283720044
  —It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up30274.867771229416
  —Yes, sir61.015732518990326
 Thanks, Sargent answered219.1381504765943
  He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench14279.353406546132
  —You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form8372211.6381825395
  —Yes, sir61.015732518990326
  In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield6044.502984336416
  —Sargent!  —Run on, Stephen said1189.9775373623804
 Mr Deasy is calling you308.5428627211617
  He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife18726.28167221842
 They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet3499.524914605411
 When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him4228.742749338058
 He turned his angry white moustache359.43283791361006
  —What is it now? he cried continually without listening2823.697266419903
  —Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said28759.366385105717
  —Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here272755.39292987646
  And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly:  —What is the matter? What is it now?  Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head9517046541.27951
  Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs17618.09488106434
 As on the first day he bargained with me here3972.837950834211
 As it was in the beginning, is now31790.25732104531
 On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be8018.78675145472
 And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end20982.903899538487
  A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor8659.674464907597
 Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table3027.6279787084254
  —First, our little financial settlement, he said1051.0828185760788
  He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong18064.434947199763
 It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table216077.0551135609
  —Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away11966.47840137975
  And now his strongroom for the gold1023.0756989497463
 Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James471468.39880256634
 An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells669.892015285061
  A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth25141.660756557707
  —Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand72806.82731680779
 These are handy things to have469.053136730674
 See68.39071693870318
 This is for sovereigns250.63987020757733
 This is for shillings265.31237643583125
 Sixpences, halfcrowns216.59306098374933
 See68.39071693870318
  He shot from it two crowns and two shillings1101.2679420409852
  —Three twelve, he said459.75941309001655
 I think you’ll find that’s right411.960920450445
  —Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers2930666.609782559
  —No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said1575.068058660277
 You have earned it252.94979590425112
  Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells8955.751563358885
 Symbols too of beauty and of power1016.0287978363282
 A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery1450.359539979112
  —Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said10074.283462641673
 You’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it816.7198089779729
 You just buy one of these machines1514.4430060580132
 You’ll find them very handy315.3674919808804

 Three times now236.8098276608452
 Three nooses round me here313.64699057565207
  —Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger17340.848786605853
 You don’t know yet what money is981.6196888337952
 Money is power251.21516118261522

 If youth but knew200.93594237226048
 But what does Shakespeare say? _Put but money in thy purse2009.4658845553663
_  —Iago, Stephen murmured403.3112760310468
  He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare3697.9338682508715
  —He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said1987.1384883466956
 He made money222.18277022981388
 A poet, yes, but an Englishman too6828.918023986646
 Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s mouth?  The seas’ ruler4158546.7641750653
 His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating169799.31163391675
  —That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets57547.778710536375
  —Ba! Mr Deasy cried464.79406211346605
 That’s not English211.04169702356216

 The lump I have is useless438.23039972176446
  —For the moment, no, Stephen answered23837.962428841507
  Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox1705.4166129323557
  —I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously8113.627021010302
 But one day you must feel it648.5658035127697
 We are a generous people but we must also be just2274.0725586171648
  —I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy39980.324172055414
  —You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said6927.175933499139
 I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time362.4342623141116
 I remember the famine in ’46460.0725404885181
 Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things533243.024985372

 But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union1910.4631642099548
 We are all Irish, all kings’ sons946.3829362018831
  —Alas, Stephen said421.2852333433918
  —_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto14564.858326203474
 He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so184913.5086178434

 You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends215440.2837403416
 I have a letter here for the press1052.0989186800637
 Sit down a moment364.93251139197594
 I have just to copy the end707.204400805411
  He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter494997.5193124919
  —Sit down202.49477788265926
 Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of common sense438875.67512359377
_ Just a moment442.4315557105566
  He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error3757669.046549187
  Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence523.1744752416538
 Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster’s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort’s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, 186633025392.445882168
 Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign847.055428910403
 He saw their speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds2596.7829529377686
  —Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys3222.190528961446

  —Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising6110.397335569818
  He came to the table, pinning together his sheets15640.600263257833
 Stephen stood up201.15964007526046
  —I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said2463.9568577378222

  —A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?  —They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely78037237.68121497
 And you can see the darkness in their eyes1901.1489763407144
 And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day16071.468762233593

 Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures1177.8671645132206
 Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain44424.276125262535
 Vain patience to heap and hoard329.42487448963976
 A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on792.9957818886369
 Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh4694.557584989948
  —Who has not? Stephen said1193.7340576920133
  —What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked5671.114958739817
  He came forward a pace and stood by the table6377.395571930204
 His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly354.56175544249334
 Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me2234.6564730623054
  —History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake331096.3057785903
  From the playfield the boys raised a shout1148.441815315421
 What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?  —The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said262159.72618584894
 All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God2185.0693314721807
  Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:  —That is God75953.76244700701
  Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!  —What? Mr Deasy asked6485.762402460099
  —A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders23040.265407482188
 Looking up again he set them free645.3932650131137
  —I am happier than you are, he said4136.180213955817

  Stephen raised the sheets in his hand1007.6747715297236
  —Well, sir, he began3848.4215117385293
  —I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work225649.6016185105
 You were not born to be a teacher, I think7810.60125099672
 Perhaps I am wrong399.54614546951115
  —A learner rather, Stephen said580.1429680367122
  And here what will you learn more?  Mr Deasy shook his head8749.447679943223
  —Who knows? he said760.5844125200963
 To learn one must be humble501.6893613312727
 But life is the great teacher751.2031339863968
  Stephen rustled the sheets again420.7484732647891
  —As regards these, he began929.5574159043196
  —Yes, Mr Deasy said378.9948496569937

 Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin3477.99674722878
  —Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket77528.2366486154
 Thank you104.5158599552309
  —Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk78905.52057828745
 I like to break a lance with you, old as I am9815.954918632831
  —Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back38540.98574776809
  He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield4147804.788069318

  Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath1324.3232603700453
  —I just wanted to say, he said4453.027069541319
 Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews73994.8242621034
 Do you know that? No681.9489180527249
  —Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile26023.45180271162
  —Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly9920.866978415956
  A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm3044.839181831537
 He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air16688.11630100352
  —She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path94173.03204139424

 Looking for something lost in a past life1463.6009690389637
 Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull15566.899536523944
 The man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears429.7118476799466

 His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse707.5587445179423
 They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves63805.560205637354
  Cocklepickers163.44048197260335
 They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out129091.67020586721
 The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning129885.10262384715
 Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting from his jaws19455.72103395139
 His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop4257.363628717412
 The carcass lay on his path592.7867771027774
 He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell863872.1892381621

  —Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!  The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight3478461.6755135804
 He slunk back in a curve852.3998145268927
 Doesn’t see me281.9285130111382
 Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it78041.23170460625

 His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved974.3707389470133

 Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words56263.59559235661
  His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending2501.8795888112477
 Why not endless till the farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds49608.19148058509

  He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant999.0952667359007

     — II —   [ 4 ]  Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls6845.677599588378
 He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes7445.222080452639
 Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine5062.957651918548
  Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray57399.6085055255
 Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere17883.879413997038
 Made him feel a bit peckish588.3176498430043

 He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire35998.00577414799
 It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out1681.3433242416052

  —Mkgnao!  —O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire3907006.834932829
  The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing28481.75890118376
 Just how she stalks over my writingtable443.095184548391

  Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form686.1512096468318
 Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes256255.33768745695
 He bent down to her, his hands on his knees51661.305113254224
  —Milk for the pussens, he said790.2726332223174
  —Mrkgnao! the cat cried573.0359763852462
  They call them stupid514.3656595296076

 Wonder what I look like to her840.330640990466
 Height of a tower? No, she can jump me17453.557489416646
  —Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly32185.852119381452
 Afraid of the chookchooks600.5856203844171
 I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens1113.7379271185312
  —Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly653.8215630796849
  She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth58888.79817380286
 He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones2535.7870016622755
 Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor4604320.084964642
  —Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap2551.325439490853
  He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly3303.017444961387
 Wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after1650.503937754295
 Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips12441.771538258421
 Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps3948.9778360798323
  He listened to her licking lap420.83376124121696
 No good eggs with this drouth422.43314041033665
 Want pure fresh water263.62414967452366
 Fried with butter, a shake of pepper1109.017971038434
 Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz’s458.5753739421672
 While the kettle is boiling468.67713182816016
 She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean605.0095429293474
 Why are their tongues so rough? To lap better, all porous holes1997.650313768246
 Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him1626.62701594154
 No34.48566147928474
  On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door28583.233676418986
 She might like something tasty440.76962619380873
 Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning2542.7999987744784
 Still perhaps: once in a way2103.149145554275
  He said softly in the bare hall:  —I’m going round the corner17580.41963879668
 Be back in a minute944.3899610345792
  And when he had heard his voice say it he added:  —You don’t want anything for breakfast?  A sleepy soft grunt answered:  —Mn7971264.514369572
  No34.48566147928474
 She didn’t want anything315.7133747174202
 He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled58609.75297977607
 Must get those settled really288.3538712519971

  —Poldy!  Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head21628.258732579776

  —A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you683440.6744165199
 And a letter for you627.1547851047579
  He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees4824.499733359702
  —Do you want the blind up?  Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow310713.3128881339
  —That do? he asked, turning7927.499015296598
  She was reading the card, propped on her elbow2040.635105627004
  —She got the things, she said826.0521311199866
  He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh9402.593039235493
  —Hurry up with that tea, she said2035.6798506713742
 I’m parched181.92676836932273
  —The kettle is boiling, he said841.942374431834
  But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed291628.91156602284
  As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:  —Poldy!  —What?  —Scald the teapot623969.2511235119
  On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout2748.9359825004663
 He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in77313.82517149374
 Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt169845.51492624305

 Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her1279.403839010861
 He smiled, pouring297.31564260084684
       O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling2247.75573333919
      You are my lookingglass from night to morning686.5461273615153
      I’d rather have you without a farthing      Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden2257.9611339387175
  Poor old professor Goodwin316.7104215521671
 Dreadful old case227.00811577020818
 Still he was a courteous old chap3019.370423634253
 Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform3524.029268175568
 And the little mirror in his silk hat1760.3032269653932
 The night Milly brought it into the parlour2310.2053805726537
 O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! All we laughed4461.5937807624105
 Sex breaking out even then335.5676695735844
 Pert little piece she was388.02659240161904
  He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray11254.183008288937
 Its hump bumped as he took it up2504.1910216137385
 Yes35.21241412103726
 He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle2478.4063167100317
  Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead191744.95048878939
  —What a time you were! she said855.0841641173554
  She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow4842.622025034164
 He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder7601.407878058213
 The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured46345.84843503784
  A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow2587.2855520616367
 In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread2391.146793336384
  —Who was the letter from? he asked2464.1528782510627
  Bold hand180.35455901564026
 Marion111.17308730493504
  —O, Boylan, she said575.0096237764268
 He’s bringing the programme266.5100438923745
  —What are you singing?  —_Là ci darem_ with J3230.6152694449547
 C23.414818345807948
 Doyle, she said, and _Love’s Old Sweet Song_61952.599022829825
  Her full lips, drinking, smiled1041.224455796023
 Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day575.1312688247826
 Like foul flowerwater210.25453271616877
  —Would you like the window open a little?  She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:  —What time is the funeral?  —Eleven, I think, he answered327234171.9332719
 I didn’t see the paper527.3904629740105
  Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed36409.89992628
 No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole3309.624584795155
  —No: that book396.5153885639475
  Other stocking189.6666154486217
 Her petticoat221.49360108956196
  —It must have fell down, she said1762.8778534242374
  He felt here and there706.7930406292244
 _Voglio e non vorrei_216.9033195321027
 Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_1846.5212382026773
 Not in the bed674.3471261547
 Must have slid down257.78909540766085
 He stooped and lifted the valance370.42594233665204
 The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot3688.8914329269705
  —Show here, she said377.06889642556587
 I put a mark in it517.6776642946184
 There’s a word I wanted to ask you3911.3601467673434
  She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word3184667.7913635476
  —Met him what? he asked1308.122565062955
  —Here, she said277.03235556425614
 What does that mean?  He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail3383.5523683893052
  —Metempsychosis?  —Yes579.2216707379082
 Who’s he when he’s at home?  —Metempsychosis, he said, frowning41276.20324534694
 It’s Greek: from the Greek1268.9695271544276
 That means the transmigration of souls381.0698028470429
  —O, rocks! she said569.7360014733113
 Tell us in plain words394.63650875509825
  He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes738.5119596122321

  —Did you finish it? he asked1457.124931354524
  —Yes, she said378.9481857385705
 There’s nothing smutty in it330.18767565836134
 Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?  —Never read it134242.20769932808

 They call it reincarnation545.3210573539696
 That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet24859.112939769228
 Some say they remember their past lives556.0961783814342
  The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea529.5912522517681
 Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis2177.733011576463

 Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then7667.014392771954
 They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance20634.249883435034
 What they called nymphs, for example789.6884244111942
  Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar787.5181148042379
 She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils1090.9060366711358
  —There’s a smell of burn, she said1317.2061918635193
 Did you leave anything on the fire?  —The kidney! he cried suddenly48585.12072795739
  He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs736530.8350812473
 Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan26149.62130534809
 By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back7650.139582840666
 Only a little burnt346.0367727935106
 He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it22840.228799672353
  Cup of tea now418.9486591537555
 He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf4565.361356167125
 Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat6499.033880003518
 Done to a turn653.65907285546
 A mouthful of tea268.80793885321884
 Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth432842.0907515158
 What was that about some young student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth15181052.707446031

 Another gone191.91595295141693
  —One of the best, M’Coy said7884.503649102618
  The tram passed250.9307173951846
 They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip10611.46190919508
 Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick11602.246880952607
  —O, yes, Mr Bloom said871.4539617114981
 Tiptop, thanks223.17074023318318
  He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:       What is home without      Plumtree’s Potted Meat?      Incomplete5464.71520590548
      With it an abode of bliss179.33833572631315

 I’m off that, thanks489.32055472344257
  Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness595.2565211216921
  —My wife too, he said928.1271026229477
 She’s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth28471.842426767154
  —That so? M’Coy said484.19429399072703
 Glad to hear that, old man2346.696123314945
 Who’s getting it up?  Mrs Marion Bloom1284.5433912074222

 _Sweeeet song_237.9144340011679
 There’s a committee formed281.4177952989711
 Part shares and part profits153.23149788417297
  M’Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble1092.9131473752095
  —O, well, he said1874.1825219679556
 That’s good news210.31732618769718
  He moved to go317.1050652325082

 Meet you knocking around292.1534126114211
  —Yes, Mr Bloom said119.27763508556683
  —Tell you what, M’Coy said952.3617381567518
 You might put down my name at the funeral, will you? I’d like to go but I mightn’t be able, you see385850.99375115166
 There’s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found501564.4414175735
 You just shove in my name if I’m not there, will you?  —I’ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off37753074.99350862
 That’ll be all right113.80648776172522
  —Right, M’Coy said brightly942.9025382602523

  Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze338.1688078532342

  Every word is so deep, Leopold681.5827335979543
  Poor papa! Poor man! I’m glad I didn’t go into the room to look at his face154903.804745083
 That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him510038.74016869994
  Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard13183.011558458598
 No use thinking of it any more958.8207553642565
 Nosebag time184.0020363740966
 Wish I hadn’t met that M’Coy fellow392.2195164829887
  He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth2230.1645712901754
 Their Eldorado186.75960980187213
 Too full for words152.0991627183738
 Still they get their feed all right and their doss1457.6961250845725
 Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches1956.3106017102557
 Might be happy all the same that way3902.3586223091315
 Good poor brutes they look331.833475338875
 Still their neigh can be very irritating398.4806366932764
  He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried110102.39471437359
 Might just walk into her here385.57799231320365
  He passed the cabman’s shelter686.5722349782064

   He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall16067.586951494151
 No-one92.131747921651

 Not annoyed then? What does she say?   Dear Henry  I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it235946.26630598112
 I am sorry you did not like my last letter1472.4396577401558
 I do wish I could punish you for that1430.9532512800934
 I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world1122.2482759666423
 Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you4303730.174646515
 Please tell me what you think of poor me1854.3772678498165

   He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket25831.69011966046
 Language of flowers303.3730747370053
 They like it because no-one can hear818.326033062656
 Or a poison bouquet to strike him down825.8713371788125
 Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word22608.29391845926

 Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket110814.39379519435
  Weak joy opened his lips359.35502444701694

  Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it35411.090560773475
 Common pin, eh? He threw it on the road37982.714260018794
 Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together1562.9953592990375
 Queer the number of pins they always have1275.3099733647518

 The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown3844144.7000249424

  He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved194866.80718584242
 He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower16716438.865741497

 Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses’ hoofs5977.102897583261

 Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying810.4455671938325

  —Who is that?  —Your son and heir6991.533275153036
  —Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across15453.793193342402
  The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels974063.3975570385
 Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:  —Was that Mulligan cad with him? His _fidus Achates_!  —No, Mr Bloom said492572.7546468364

  —He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said1252.8293997270061
 Yes, he does443.9598733772804
 How do you do?  —Who? Mr Dedalus asked5109.535204380085
  —Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said1285.4148546608694
 There he is airing his quiff394.5796030701177
  Mr Dedalus bent across to salute542.465762521977
 From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed251865.08131697937
  Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand51093.507598434284
 The nails, yes309.42815915245603
 Is there anything more in him that they she sees? Fascination2444.164650537665

  He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces9861.285785272878
  Mr Power asked:  —How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?  —O, very well, Mr Bloom said4700449.893910248
 I hear great accounts of it381.4164448294917

5.498166464669896
  —Are you going yourself?  —Well no, Mr Bloom said9174.262519806967
 In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business236900.95238859655

  Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power335.9465665608578
  —Of the tribe of Reuben, he said2445.147859361191
  A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine225799.84405192515
  Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:  —The devil break the hasp of your back!  Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray’s statue19300757.174200676
  —We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly6473.608518302701
  His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes561.3603850615782
 He caressed his beard, adding:  —Well, nearly all of us36995.751064618504
  Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces2110.0684014361113
  —That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son4004.4425588120166
  —About the boatman? Mr Power asked788.4031127480118
  —Yes68.08775078611336
 Isn’t it awfully good?  —What is that? Mr Dedalus asked68646.91211873788
 I didn’t hear it295.1797911016973
  —There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were both2938984079.4746737
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
  —What? Mr Dedalus asked413.4608659148942
 That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?  —Yes, Mr Bloom said18664.512612160615
 They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown78854.80049494193
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896

  —Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried975.4816332914265
 I wish to Christ he did!  Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils13454.309446131874
  —No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself11867.68755870189

5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
  Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:  —Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey39189524.4618453
  —For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright1903.158061427551
 Is he dead?  —Dead! Martin Cunningham cried2904.229330919459
 Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive19424055.513101146
 Half the town was there467.71247125484655
  —Yes, Mr Bloom said119.27763508556683

  A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand819.578225545756
  —O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed15195.914941330853
 Like a hero274.0912542130094
 A silver florin247.4824422197874
  —Isn’t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly11375.32894142868
  —One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily12401.239777230288
  Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage1483.4493906362172
  —Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!  —We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said148050.30040345486
  Mr Dedalus sighed215.6407087857786
  —Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh69079.65828553042
 Many a good one he told himself2090.593490625248
  —The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers56043.980058631096
 Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this12262082.980679447
 He’s gone from us283.0817492926497
 He went very suddenly246.86330428634517

  Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension1303.302873450279
  —He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said15790.207115074789
  —The best death, Mr Bloom said800.7747350938927
  Their wide open eyes looked at him816.6821211823328
  —No suffering, he said381.76678393564237

  Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back5784.180250093086
  —The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added13897.383605863499
  —Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively15425.747997362432

 Wouldn’t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?  —Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted983164.2001021603
  —And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road734939.9337457204
  —That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road139767.99127047235

 Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it251017.23386972887
 He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously25857.565401836302

  Mr Kernan assured him238.33658361390144
  —Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked11055.975364238167
 I know his face171.56971479678813
  Ned Lambert glanced back277.9101482211688
  —Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano1223850.396015513
 She’s his wife254.4771913912113
  —O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said16532.0985553683
 I haven’t seen her for some time971.3693546713198
 She was a finelooking woman610.0364313516928
 I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown36304.694746808374
 And a good armful she was516.1086076002832
  He looked behind through the others455.1125398894965
  —What is he? he asked3224.172926058042
 What does he do? Wasn’t he in the stationery line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls293528.0642820887
  Ned Lambert smiled223.51963962472803
  —Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely’s317438.1579420669
 A traveller for blottingpaper268.4863423494036
  —In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for? She had plenty of game in her then2329929.8933376847
  —Has still, Ned Lambert said751.8562158100029

 He never forgets a friend351.1258413747343
  Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence703.7256627545981
 Mr Dedalus said:  —I am come to pay you another visit94835.13455659003
  —My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice2225.480596046722
 I don’t want your custom at all457.4980109462956
  Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back93083.46166739023
  —Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?  —I did not, Martin Cunningham said4163249.9944266737
 The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles14816.292865855183
  —They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs8095458.947052838
 They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried8812.00439918992
 After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough3501.718684676965
 One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy3310.7523276052284
 The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up14015.460067176673
  The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed7030.963345497182
 He resumed:  —And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he7087398.397255044
  Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked124951.61112774732
  —I know, Hynes said557.5940449477041
 I know that186.4565619690156
  —To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said844.272409380694
 It’s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else361.7311310461423

 Mr Bloom turned away his face450.6620873514596

  The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat6454.232871750749
 Had enough of it461.6069164630906
 The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show5261.829266332383
 Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves110058.84076819736
 Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields2497.2061573107353

 But he knows them all496.4575109191873

 Where is he now?  —M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling7428.563935683269
 I don’t know who he is799.7148874691856
 Is that his name?  He moved away, looking about him8707.583176241858
  —No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping3123.2088012796107
 I say, Hynes!  Didn’t hear1163.8759016408658
 What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign4014.3931309363497

 Good Lord, what became of him?  A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade25709.9899442093
  —O, excuse me!  He stepped aside nimbly2632.9783591599107
  Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole30025.028231580905
 It rose180.69577712210466
 Nearly over198.8935661516232
 A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades36095.547648908294
 All uncovered again for a few instants2172.98129630874
 The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump6264.297619996147
 The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow3542.4237642299654
 Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean1622.7946375804097
 One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass1320.3547627725766
 One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing2601.9385310146545
 Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband532.7486613783452

  The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb13812.504294081766
  —Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said4038.5238476422996
 We have time228.27631796904765
  —Let us, Mr Power said539.765172020266
  They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts2679.942167444633
 With awe Mr Power’s blank voice spoke:  —Some say he is not in that grave at all39676.41582781214
 That the coffin was filled with stones590.5328360524754
 That one day he will come again1077.856903665849
  Hynes shook his head303.20908625558496

 He’s there, all that was mortal of him2791.6267697381095
 Peace to his ashes309.7740856996395
  Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland’s hearts and hands29511.852556462396

 Who has the most matches?  THE CALUMET OF PEACE   He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself22215.650690814986

  The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow35085.84399407733
 He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:       ’Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,      ’Twas empire charmed thy heart38293.67206751508
  The professor grinned, locking his long lips598.4419693261068
  —Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said2424.144598312092
  He took a cigarette from the open case1391.3400401540152

 O’Molloy said gently176.58608878535856
 It sounds nobler than British or Brixton363.35057881775134
 The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire843.9153874443065

 Wait a moment134.04671754274048
 Let me say one thing332.3619388563301
 The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society27182.526853631753
 Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue580573.2300256708
  He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:  —You know Gerald Fitzgibbon22687.59962024767

  —He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s frock245797.6533299374
 Well?  —It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement344671200.8031714
 It was then a new movement819.9218601152124
 We were weak, therefore worthless363.29088765186947
  He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus4043032.0067818346
  IMPROMPTU   In ferial tone he addressed J399.4483748188282

 O’Molloy:  —Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed28462.972497060156
 That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall363692.09065529687
 His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it1193.4602149102639
 He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man30264.468421582435

 His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair2852.122577201531
 Still seeking, he said:  —When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply172651.92357774102
 Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these45974.72531804298
  He raised his head firmly329.17812584977287
 His eyes bethought themselves once more422.0876177907327
 Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet3885.5112435459396
  He began:  _—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend2738320.546791341
 It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses2211897294.040829

 I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me1395.2827262392962
_  FROM THE FATHERS   It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted569005.279412016
 Ah, curse you! That’s saint Augustine681.73189111211

 You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe161326.8628164953

_  A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech589.4197538226315
 He lifted his voice above it boldly:  _—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day924348168543.5735
 He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw57292296.68179887

 They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn190468.88571319988
 They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits21530902478.005676

  Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called:  —Mr Crawford! A moment!  —_Telegraph_! Racing special!  —What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace287038180974.2613
  A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face:  —Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!  INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR   —Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket334676959.2587604

 They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings134009966.55414091

 No tram in sight259.6744456944524
 Wants to cross284.2666138647731
  —Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked2703.3258636451806
  The blind stripling did not answer433.50874067085994
 His wallface frowned weakly210.45552129955342
 He moved his head uncertainly377.4885619177748

 Do you want to cross? There’s nothing in the way10002.01355297732
  The cane moved out trembling to the left919.3315446650012
 Mr Bloom’s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks’ van drawn up before Drago’s5156.499066591962

  —Come, Mr Bloom said440.1873933543686
  He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward3898.066868933479

  The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again76122.21803940149
  Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed1717.8853146557547
 Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there? Must have felt it36230.50621072864

 Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones29819.45475440135
 Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn’t that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest279450.830709469

 Kind of a form in his mind’s eye2359.101414391987

  —Haines is gone, he said786.4715622234562
  —Is he?  —I was showing him Jubainville’s book22511.453528525013

  From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen1658.5741598150994
  —Mallarmé, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris695190.3678435548

 Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin1355.4534884395146

 Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!  —The play begins7499.649971080923
 A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice382426.6186119588
 He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name:       Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit,  bidding him list4044537.3152845073
 To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever394152780.7819963
  Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son’s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet’s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?  —But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently3.636934310434389e+18

  —The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could10284682.928126791
  —Bosh! Stephen said rudely431.5434912219028
 A man of genius makes no mistakes831.0627819469906
 His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery956.0931399671011
  Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous8745.526704830132
  —A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine46669.25946802753
 What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?  —Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world107318.59818606453
 What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit nomen!_), Socratididion’s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know1556653.4389072838
 But neither the midwife’s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock8484.383784589256
  —But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best’s quiet voice said forgetfully918.2873860296944
  His look went from brooder’s beard to carper’s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned25314.712784500247
  —He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory183522.06920545138
 He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling _The girl I left behind me12482.944263576697
_ If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows774053.7115178545

 Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and beautiful986.6199582631504

  —Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic81251.42629379568

  —But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn’t it? Mr Best pleaded42117.844646401616

  —As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image7987592.499802875
 And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth522327821.3206637
 In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be62340901.3045156

 Why does he send to one who is a _buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written _Romeo and Juliet_1569911496.7001443

 Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland1788931.5869715228

 His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit588310.262075685

  —It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion419383121.4021259
 Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife529949.6177750046
 But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow3205.789381296312

 All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan’s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killed her first24381339191643.383

  Woa!  —Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type194021.42702501343
  —He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer187863338.0271995
 Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?  —It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely82326717.74518111

 He has revealed it in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus26321.5522779492

  —You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays55214.624204401436
 Why did he take them rather than others? Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what’s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow4759752.169387619
 Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered2182.560013631794

 Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare’s reverence, the angel of the world40805.60768559135
 Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney’s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?  —That was Will’s way, John Eglinton defended8178672.526187775

 He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle710.0858748500667
  —Why? Stephen answered himself482.74807284895246
 Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him403248.386972031
 The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book1724932.0368545742
 It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe122941.03179591699
 It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery278168.6075921325
 The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth1657.592243792961

 Age has not withered it351.3334874012693
 Beauty and peace have not done it away895.7149354730979

 The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself1.6417172025068508e+16

  He read, _marcato:_  —Characters:       TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)      CRAB (a bushranger)      MEDICAL DICK )          and      ) (two birds with one stone)      MEDICAL DAVY )      MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)      FRESH NELLY          and      ROSALIE (the coalquay whore)18488713.888377666
  He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:  —O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!  —The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them694852262438459.6

 Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown134059.592603896
  Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square359.00771052876047
 He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days10399452819.30623
_ He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M12394.536407978097

  —Very well, indeed, father1533.3483672927607
 And you, father?  Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed2785.30770564009
 He would go to Buxton probably for the waters1334.8146615463393
 And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that279479.4593964971
 And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London785.484122025819
 The house was still sitting, to be sure it was6978.2450771787

 Yes, he would certainly call1820.056623418194
  —Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy493.61700454410624
  Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun998422.7230144192
 And smiled yet again, in going1020.0219167285233
 He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste2825.9180552361076
  Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice24206.795551252526
  —Pilate! Wy don’t you old back that owlin mob?  A zealous man, however2776.3238678460466
 Really he was280.10835730381393

 That letter to father provincial497.59708141732426
  Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square4544.922659112676

 Gallaher172.05903793643458
 And the other little man? His name was Brunny Lynam7904.261585883325
  Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street441317.4067066906
  —But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said7045.1965787730105
  The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:  —O, sir12747.698034898722
  —Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said67301.23230831318
  Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox70899.37883845919
 Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east2438.665452819214
  Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court65312379.33005412
  Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?  Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed79967.60736403188
 And Father Conmee smiled and saluted1185.0071039879506
 How did she do?  A fine carriage she had1559.608562412343
 Like Mary, queen of Scots, something1407.5747953635544

  A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street643.3938506760379
 All raised untidy caps243.54980001133347
 Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly1023.7923103987731

 Saint Joseph’s church, Portland row419.9071364392656
 For aged and virtuous females279.2302573816004
 Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament4347.018614071038
 Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered682.8339734477613
  Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman1709.370145751201
 And now it was an office or something1758.8562888659883
  Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop621017.1913188591
 Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter7596.976319030899
 He passed Grogan’s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York3324.343741078809
 In America those things were continually happening417.2751806436155
 Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared4119.4468636410165
 Still, an act of perfect contrition941.0301436014062
  Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged6024.825043145169
 They saluted him and were saluted470.78191587634063
  Father Conmee passed H219.7519003799426

 O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay5219.681215967744
 A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable17396.766040776383
 In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes35136.50812014359
  Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him1713715.955543423
 It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people38172394.46823737
  On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S705.5899090744772
 J14.764669680725877
 of saint Francis Xavier’s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram11586.389210603656
  Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C1078.8558936371276
 C23.414818345807948
 of saint Agatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge2185.516334388127
  At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island19690.99011623545
  Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse16468923.659080029
 Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket11819.572376356067
 The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap52073.62317974861
 Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum263.15702061426623
  It was a peaceful day580.0502041677678
 The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down3788.2662816132447
 A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses37287.948862004654
 She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly28242.369596346554
  Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car640.9153769332147
 He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat467146.7423516732
  Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head114916.74862247525
  At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight6681948.787627737
 The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her1848.2990944868195
 She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been absolved, _pray for me132833908411144.39
_ But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures12134.610682693858
  From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee1432.5215417592249
 J14.764669680725877
 and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night55665219.27672311
 That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea12985.254110777407
 Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D52850.51208991083
V109.13271957944679
) been brought203.16423889746727
 But they were God’s souls, created by God1414.0736522004383
 It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say75833.87088533018
  At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn12361.769028996543
  The Malahide road was quiet291.56059688112737
 It pleased Father Conmee, road and name1126.3743494737864
 The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide411.2959022275788
 Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining2733.8691482497024
 Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day28867.502460841948
 Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony6239.590614448628
  Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere227885458.49864474
  A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged588911.1450475577
 Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with her husband’s brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did22557258.478649948
 Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother5980.617213118513
  Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways800459.8684769163
  Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore2926.122964315414
 He was humane and honoured there330.314249040407
 He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters7301.510962225108
 And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee51272.7544695116
  It was a charming day622.7781258682645
  The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves5574.081830015574
 The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind4498.807292160348
 _Moutonner,_ the French said1133.1171453514396
 A just and homely word324.473269718127
  Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey3950.185716851971
 His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field1014.3696337600529
 He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening963620.6168939044
 He was their rector: his reign was mild643.4234998584508
  Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out2762.4705149402903
 An ivory bookmark told him the page619.1390737618473
  Nones169.55983776003015
 He should have read that before lunch895.834606310141
 But lady Maxwell had come326.2041423395128
  Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast13512.673489658866
 _Deus in adiutorium254.6142062382926
_  He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ193118.0382072248
_  A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand187382.20622133755
 The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig23813.097749567307
  Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary1727.2048448670134
 _Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum846.2944897201961
 He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings48270.82699264324
 Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway17638.45829889688
 There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out15043.116152882063
  Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge1416.4550838974662
  Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay7763.215070269215
  Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day29946.339404092378
  —That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher1588.4425892085083
  —Ay, Corny Kelleher said222.95082754005122
  —It’s very close, the constable said951.5921478831741
  Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin86998.36701663799
  —What’s the best news? he asked541.2935111394144
  —I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath6450.898510587472
  *    *    *   A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirting Rabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street7941.577198465178
 Towards Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:  —_For England_53852.8030265811
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
  He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled:  —_home and beauty26941.52539090741

 O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor23074.913738242776
  A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her81950.63207457401
 The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides27530.19632242043
  He halted and growled angrily:  —_For England_4710.139210511233
5.498166464669896
  Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths10701.637582756694
  He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply:  —_home and beauty68181.59306330705
_  The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased3095.735030653503
 The blind of the window was drawn aside1177.031094935809
 A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell780.3510322621986
 A woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings2948.806643607135
 It fell on the path507.57638757113745
  One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel’s cap, saying:  —There, sir2986178.463519881
  *    *    *   Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen14087.411357310164
  —Did you put in the books? Boody asked1462.853056769457
  Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow6545.380532012504
  —They wouldn’t give anything on them, she said1851.43297010158
  Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble1671.8973647482767
  —Where did you try? Boody asked764.0696631385475
  —M’Guinness’s165.0629126857539
  Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table2020.7063160802052
  —Bad cess to her big face! she cried1017.8123725310919
  Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes3773.343815470916
  —What’s in the pot? she asked915.9310196078384
  —Shirts, Maggy said213.18815035031298
  Boody cried angrily:  —Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?  Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:  —And what’s in this?  A heavy fume gushed in answer99348049.69615038
  —Peasoup, Maggy said200.60371449294755
  —Where did you get it? Katey asked1732.3912824324723
  —Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said321.97696096520235
  The lacquey rang his bell249.47002078001478
  —Barang!  Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:  —Give us it here100695.40060727965
  Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl1317.9520478807121
 Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs:  —A good job we have that much843426.5510113072
 Where’s Dilly?  —Gone to meet father, Maggy said1065.282161581838
  Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:  —Our father who art not in heaven73654.95804305805
  Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey’s bowl, exclaimed:  —Boody! For shame!  A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George’s quay47192659.414840885
  *    *    *   The blond girl in Thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre2917.6738655745417
 Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar4307.2243859045175
  —Put these in first, will you? he said3166.978657581413

  —That’ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said957.3773037231028
  She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches2665.4421326643787

  —Certainly, sir145.46770978293026
 Is it in the city?  —O, yes, Blazes Boylan said495104.2255281066

  The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil975.7890950011395
  —Will you write the address, sir?  Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her85511.80281339968

 It’s for an invalid282.00468552152734

  Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers’ pocket1284.675691167896

  The blond girl’s slim fingers reckoned the fruits467.7216877476559
  Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse1489.212970814231
 A young pullet237.44280909533205
 He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass866.6393577618469

  The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing60600.373472387604
  —Yes, sir, she said402.27155479367906
  Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches556.8291483335596
  Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth21160.169639563417

  Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests2202.803018865211

 Mother of Moses!  *    *    *   Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat80945.06745836211
  —See? he said306.4367523489446
 Say it’s turn six279.2952401162848
 In here, see474.05647195570936
 Turn Now On135.11024476152704
  He slid it into the left slot for them3551.535837447956
 It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six1551.7227920085359
  Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude382395517.32302195
  —See? he said306.4367523489446
 See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over4729.257980338481
 The impact209.58701128280416
 Leverage, see?  He showed them the rising column of disks on the right21777.39052676277
  —Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling1224.8827094301087
 So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over5908.4294458703325
  —See? Tom Rochford said329.8100503850245
  He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four5637.543834897664
 Turn Now On135.11024476152704
  —I’ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him171050.14929557178
 One good turn deserves another312.0966386205553
  —Do, Tom Rochford said388.5511118388846
 Tell him I’m Boylan with impatience390.5758746192603
  —Goodnight, M’Coy said abruptly839.3749258770634
 When you two begin321.35227078740303
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
  —But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked2381.4572475385294
  —Tooraloo, Lenehan said298.65564098201196
 See you later239.95879975349823
  —He’s a hero, he said simply5462.010605637494
  —I know, M’Coy said279.06595322407986
 The drain, you mean681.9205161303119
  —Drain? Lenehan said290.1953974885973
 It was down a manhole496.14302274105415
  They passed Dan Lowry’s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile14815.62572874871
  Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M’Coy how the whole thing was24250.332385525726
 One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas955203.2129872557
 Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky’s vest and all, with the rope round him53755.16490794582
 And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up221356.44189223135
  —The act of a hero, he said3251.5257193535717
  At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street2797.4409734620917
  —This way, he said, walking to the right18686.74953434977
 I want to pop into Lynam’s to see Sceptre’s starting price1099.2324106391125
 What’s the time by your gold watch and chain?  M’Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses’ sombre office, then at O’Neill’s clock39705.84086342462
  —After three, he said482.0090838753342
 Who’s riding her?  —O1558.6224773762847
 Madden, Lenehan said319.58078498630954
 And a game filly she is434.16741572863856
  While he waited in Temple bar M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter10699.408333408595
 Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark5261.043366500136
  The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade4649.309637117239
  —Even money, Lenehan said returning1593.984682058862
 I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an earthly30443.565532570574
 Through here184.95049044945546
  —There he is, Lenehan said939.1251809425563
  —Wonder what he’s buying, M’Coy said, glancing behind5271.739760261504
  —_Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye,_ Lenehan said4203.6540191514405
  —He’s dead nuts on sales, M’Coy said650.0549600590849
 There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails84817.23970473964
 Astronomy it was about500.3682733862699
  Lenehan laughed187.8865539221494
  —I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said7704.859091760946
 Come over in the sun792.8160506464427
  They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall6233.22330372763
  Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks44296.761108391154
  —There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly20852.301537291172
 The annual dinner, you know564.2367370853233
 Boiled shirt affair223.78462147253168
 The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music442119.82738622284
 Bartell d’Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard375.6646624678851
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
  —I know, M’Coy broke in579.0700859979503
 My missus sang there once327.0829809229746
  —Did she? Lenehan said439.9541762103874
  A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street1483.5338787744236
  He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh3754.8173781443447
  —But wait till I tell you, he said1385.038969847227
 Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher1064.430162492897
 Bloom and the wife were there1868.06522290622
 Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice5141.471670122368
 Fast and furious it was604.1650045870817
 After liquids came solids230.8884421102478

5.498166464669896
  Lenehan linked his arm warmly426.9562487211126
  —But wait till I tell you, he said1385.038969847227
 We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the morning after the night before264070.9268374974
 Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s night on the Featherbed Mountain14167.856620920458
 Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other5154062.92267002
 We started singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_2453.144689953854
 She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband1947.3745335248127
 Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me2750.952424694853
 Hell’s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her6380.423253952118
 Like that123.72886556243495
  He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:  —I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time501268.8393060485
 Know what I mean?  His hands moulded ample curves of air4365.526566724809
 He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips15901.834922638971
  —The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh34200.75509821173
 She’s a gamey mare and no mistake534.0651180207287
 But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way1487154.1746890133
 He knows them all, faith1006.4864995007839
 At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away849.6593136899219
 _And what star is that, Poldy?_ says she6004.3847171417365
 _That one, is it?_ says Chris Callinan, _sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick413651.9687732741
_ By God, he wasn’t far wide of the mark5917.543351694344
  Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter1926.0599297117212
  —I’m weak, he gasped426.03460788854954
  M’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave1468.9397504439723
 Lenehan walked on again385.1431801185608
 He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly501.7802790720371
 He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy704.6114345705471
  —He’s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously13711.66035643519
 He’s not one of your common or garden1243.4174170385354

 There’s a touch of the artist about old Bloom1319.8766192286153

  He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch16384.449691916314
  The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter1331.5411191730109
  —Them are two good ones, he said1113.7748846323307
  Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth15207.338150274298
 He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain213274.08146240894
  On O’Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c6491.701330890835
  Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles5584.424538194414
 Know the kind that is454.20276421677926
 Had it? Yes474.7088745291484
  He opened it215.92536460649157
 Thought so131.11901174915235
  A woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain472.0439456386922

  No: she wouldn’t like that much734.5974005752603
 Got her it once297.0070900296428
  He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_4193.961634558824
 More in her line477.4764483021432
 Let us see224.20325182316338
  He read where his finger opened469.06166509401976
  _—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies7848.566095452566

  The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint2935.616629967298
  Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman2993.3773193187876

 Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up702.3575525990327

 Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions!  Young! Young!  An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king’s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation884667030111176.0
  Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains4685.6170115325785
 The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing3058.954708199246
 He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor1031.9808830481086
 He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired154636.65645897365
  Mr Bloom beheld it236.0329734925524
  Mastering his troubled breath, he said:  —I’ll take this one140832.15755436884
  The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum422.80910321911045
  —_Sweets of Sin,_ he said, tapping on it63348.70470389283
 That’s a good one481.4103128897209
  *    *    *   The lacquey by the door of Dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet422918.26736664085

  Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams’s row2162.8756951446444
 He halted near his daughter394.3554169342222
  —It’s time for you, she said2260.1604643699675
  —Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said7729.087875642976
 Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder? Melancholy God!  Dilly shrugged her shoulders12020.697566217152
 Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back5259.736730949328
  —Stand up straight, girl, he said794.8771295026087
 You’ll get curvature of the spine366.3529417546863

  —Give it up, father, Dilly said4091.017253877085
 All the people are looking at you1377.0269706169975
  Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache1531.1543526780918
  —Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said1863.579512810061
 There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence747.5617067934206
  —You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes9055.845780517038
  —How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek131433.43055556447
  Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James’s street1742.7914149726407
  —I know you did, Dilly answered1680.5521920765752
 Were you in the Scotch house now?  —I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling18372960.34116608
 Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy? Here11965.490720196234
  He handed her a shilling415.7252399034894

 I’ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews897.6349197061187
 Look, there’s all I have601.4184183344931
 I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral7052.10680920158
  He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously1599.679843535572
  —Can’t you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said1505.737212239298
  Mr Dedalus thought and nodded334.79502502544113
 I looked all along the gutter in O’Connell street1227.839660781441
 I’ll try this one now330.9333624653511
  —You’re very funny, Dilly said, grinning1648.5496037248531
  —Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies9123.747156623283
 Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something7276.567333697525
 I’ll be home shortly289.3983347984397
  He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on14969.679065735721
  The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate5728.435684450052
  —I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said1094.4097137728181
  The lacquey banged loudly233.10343330962334
  Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently:  —The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn’t do anything! O, sure they wouldn’t really! Is it little sister Monica!  *    *    *   From the sundial towards James’s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James’s street, past Shackleton’s offices212133342918.60324
 Got round him all right549.8506049672643
 How do you do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir3197.609169558456
 I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico5677.295778948179
 How are things going? Just keeping alive637.3435587142649
 Lovely weather we’re having288.0678179104349
 Yes, indeed160.95633230229447
 Good for the country707.5355326121364

 Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties654.4908468432841

 Men trampling down women and children629.9177174854561
 Most brutal thing215.4201726014929
 What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion1073.1327736743451
 Most scandalous revelation232.14701663963456
 Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst925.5265553285739

 You know why? Palm oil419.25610346913027
 Is that a fact? Without a doubt1300.7301938812197

 And America they say is the land of the free6166.02052661938
 I thought we were bad here419.7234062956672

 Well, of course, where there’s money going there’s always someone to pick it up11154.591648537818

  Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness’s visitors’ waitingroom41543.269533052546
 Outside the Dublin Distillers Company’s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel6078.6495088804595
 Damn dangerous thing215.28521511255096

 Dust webbed the window and the showtrays774.3968837269365
 Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails693.001160485189
 Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones4262.864499416999
  Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness166279.65494599767

  They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter’s385.94544826219607
 Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand808.392332282392
  —What’s the best news? Mr Dedalus said898.9327780090557
  —Why then not much, Father Cowley said883.8376750542457
 I’m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance16300.445920397615

 All I want is a little time1277.6555776199386
  He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck81711.60972895846
  —I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding4604.805241265104
 Poor old bockedy Ben! He’s always doing a good turn for someone2455.035049376983
 Hold hard!  He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant19422.69439450105
  —There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets98821.93547736536
  Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge6743.44001848374

  —Hold him now, Ben Dollard said1399.9405779488134
  Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard’s figure1482.0162640001752
 Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:  —That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?  —Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw11540674711.081388
  He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:  —They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow162652238.29330432
  —Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said3800.089952071355
 Thanks be to God he’s not paid yet1071.687279071008

  Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club7066.182870003434
  Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth a deep note3334.735745830492
  —Aw! he said418.69274047250786
  —That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone13852.777556891586

  —For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously20821.01775617141
  Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright667394.8958477142
  —What few days? he boomed497.52883676916963
 Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?  —He has, Father Cowley said6517.179262610455
  —Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben Dollard said6973.7613906196675
 The landlord has the prior claim281.8000439942237
 I gave him all the particulars1270.8507845307274
 29 Windsor avenue213.34939352294325
 Love is the name?  —That’s right, Father Cowley said26599.949843827708
 The reverend Mr Love413.3906345151748
 He’s a minister in the country somewhere1028.9254152536937
 But are you sure of that?  —You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts84274528.58324994
  He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk1484.3296101025308
  —Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them2130491.5620018505
  The policeman touched his forehead356.06041899115974
  He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street7423.936802948935
  Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel32467.66001230643
  —Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard3356.590310864429
 I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him6887.062705030252
  —You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward6744.94942673778
 Touch me not268.73204248831723
  John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill11502.758119787526
  On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending24118.60135375292
  The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street801.4172952347568
  —Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_ office111280.0845477975
 I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings1628.445541082433
  —Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list17283.651536995963
 And put down the five shillings too784.829542944213
  —Without a second word either, Mr Power said1704.2255454835417
  —Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added1423.4775992280038
  John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes486.24035225200873
  —I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly3199.9311369340076
  They went down Parliament street503.4536395617358
  —There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s7992.863994144973
  —Righto, Martin Cunningham said336.2693289553273
 Here goes119.24720833647676
  Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties18373.166853793475
  John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches1821112.2165385769
  —The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power18105.10465548111
  They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms1861.4460614175234
 The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate1059.3556656031724
 Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance6213.7561209921605
  —And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life141571.94210883288
  The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood8910.516586246104
  —Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted59071.32081255471
  Long John Fanning made no way for them1129.408316588038
 He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces6051.937052573041
  —Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk34438.490505934
  Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language7725.940376980291
 Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber172272.87339747834
 And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him73244927.16708356
 Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers1257.6240330049345
  Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips2332.4067405894243
  Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace1022017.9377729278
  —What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked3721.529306869059
  Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot1552.3683766536562
  —O, my corns! he said plaintively5651.690460234117
 Come upstairs for goodness’ sake till I sit down somewhere1469.1678068868341
 Uff! Ooo! Mind!  Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and passed in and up the stairs25187.36710275004
  —Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff12576.051491666403
 I don’t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though5694.435792631452
  With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in3402.682266338739
  —Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror7487250.482725943
  Long John Fanning could not remember him756.7228785691264
  Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air597.2345156385987
  —What’s that? Martin Cunningham said548.7091281880703
  All turned where they stood381.3526243157061
 John Wyse Nolan came down again503.7344765399805
 From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering81188.07590459146
 Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly2507.423550892249
 In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders1178.8283050956097
  —What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase294193.08461175574
  —The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot27744.582012353374
  *    *    *   As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines:  —Parnell’s brother14225.484671787694
 There in the corner873.1166809384434
  They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard51988.86462906666
  —Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat10870.384017977549
  —Yes, Mulligan said312.2330379262674
 That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal1944.8508410134064
  John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested48807.3538555869
 An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner115362.16866484059
  —I’ll take a _mélange,_ Haines said to the waitress14454.903557832014
  —Two _mélanges,_ Buck Mulligan said774.5562073087018
 And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well3462.809951613588
  When she had gone he said, laughing:  —We call it D261346.58457492743
B31.328201363556943
C23.414818345807948
 because they have damn bad cakes493.10001957663576
 O, but you missed Dedalus on _Hamlet1245.5714162067409
_  Haines opened his newbought book352.2734096461779
  —I’m sorry, he said665.6518052213622
 Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance2909.648420517965
5.498166464669896
  Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter669.0158405774155
  —You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance155657.75821703684
 Wandering Ængus I call him361.8200099390732
  —I am sure he has an _idée fixe,_ Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger195079.86497124474
 Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be6061.202620856946
 Such persons always have260.02110115712725
  Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely551.82913793507
  —They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell36893.31631059296
 He will never capture the Attic note616.2740567592276
 The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth8847.368810347953
 That is his tragedy323.1498082121912
 He can never be a poet1359.593003822994
 The joy of creation269.45405261680054
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
  —Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly4049.2434947419315
 I see91.059114614709
 I tackled him this morning on belief993.933680652197
 There was something on his mind, I saw14401.552889622844
 It’s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that6136.017552303348
  Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come531.6106601192856
 He helped her to unload her tray441.09820217586054
  —He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups33231.72496734111
 The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution4059.329657650898
 Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea1367.8526223480849
 Does he write anything for your movement?  He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream7125.357046490662
 Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith1462.3360955319129
 He bit off a soft piece hungrily612.9438423249355
  —Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing21462.679788044337
 He is going to write something in ten years3040.6726534347863
  —Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon13971.28586360602
 Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all5056.43395094639
  He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup1098.8995613687587
  —This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance43257.983284490045
 I don’t want to be imposed on972.1077364460591
  Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks500735.3644176604
  *    *    *   Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell’s yard3794.3238724718453
 Behind him Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith’s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square60448.46154043398
 Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park26557.707469596826
  Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling80532.02394746113
  At the corner of Wilde’s house he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke’s lawn126648.7823384232
 His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun595.8520233803484
 With ratsteeth bared he muttered:  —_Coactus volui2860.1721238868204
_  He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word1817.0217783467733
  As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body33443.56990512619
 The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form1041.5891584508586
  —God’s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You’re blinder nor I am, you bitch’s bastard!  *    *    *   Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling32687660036.44203
 It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s7846145.174098491
 And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing2014.7949807764226
  After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him3962.8862169501695
 He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props8105.482122621086
 From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently493.5856099197284
 Myler Keogh, Dublin’s pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns24087.36394666128
 Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see1178.5776786453612
 Myler Keogh, that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash25929.733546302017
 I could easy do a bunk on ma546.8640035703422
 Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned2249.750762334064
 That’s me in mourning369.5870365474587
 When is it? May the twentysecond3540.948383760518
 Sure, the blooming thing is all over1079.080784690544
 He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up506993.56288677204
 Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers194127.63255383764
 One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out9003728.444350654
  Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on879.3182814240012
 The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons780.8702717039617
 One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man73616.60141148223
 But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all34600.05276621883
  In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time8331765.869961085
  No Sandymount tram206.76812086132492
  Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand3228.735306282602
 His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down2110.4590104714835
 The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it5219.737815615373
 He met schoolboys with satchels283.1318756943192
 I’m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday794.8852243867902
 He met other schoolboys252.41136264058017
 Do they notice I’m in mourning? Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight19497.89195802684
 Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s name102026.39324688747
  His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye1668260.5548212589
 The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs299640.1610210034
  Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend162428.01189934576
 A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking4394.807574171154
 Never see him again291.4125956085855

  The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays35394.407794249135
 The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis7457.202476885483
 At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar1965.8351417638664

 In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise29168.723078439
 Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King’s windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty13667774.83815187
 From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan’s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage4894.480712865913
 Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head watched and admired70912.76614608483
 On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff’s office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low152292.46195569812

 On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M’Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by16002.967680599912
 Passing by Roger Greene’s office and Dollard’s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby’s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn’t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring’s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant383450172688.30664
 Beyond Lundy Foot’s from the shaded door of Kavanagh’s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland35235.09390247855

 And  —There’s your teas, he said1083.7743230266954
  Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low3759.3710030127527

  Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce  —Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated16292.260100503881
 I asked that old fogey in Boyd’s for something for my skin1656.418367481504
  Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:  —O, don’t remind me of him for mercy’ sake!  —But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated195808607.3189431
  Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers2566.240931907373
  —No, don’t, she cried747.2108346101187
  —I won’t listen, she cried866.3908136223731
  Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again:  —Don’t let me think of him or I’ll expire1196311.4133839896

 Will you ever forget his goggle eye?  Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:  —And your other eye!  Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner’s name497098.42950731935

 Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes4075.478779177914

 There’s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God’s quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street15643497972.475565
  —Circumcised? says Joe252.30685803492491
  —Ay, says I148.15087795017584
 A bit off the top765.8745155141139
 An old plumber named Geraghty328.43989525505503
 I’m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can’t get a penny out of him108209.50254240044
  —That the lay you’re on now? says Joe853.7363147186371
  —Ay, says I148.15087795017584
 But that’s the most notorious bloody robber you’d meet in a day’s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain91193.31133974719
 _Tell him,_ says he, _I dare him,_ says he, _and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does,_ says he, _I’ll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence6124756448227.016
_ And he after stuffing himself till he’s fit to burst1664.6840721585734
 Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out5042.884030027801
 _He drink me my teas435.11906462696123
 He eat me my sugars305.57650867785736
 Because he no pay me my moneys?_  For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin’s parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E25715420.75524426

  —Are you a strict t409.7692908430316
t42.57803366505022
? says Joe204.05246428937926
  —Not taking anything between drinks, says I605.9395100389269
  —What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe1495.6211824582072
  —Who? says I148.8509099009586
 Sure, he’s out in John of God’s off his head, poor man21905.533043448126
  —Drinking his own stuff? says Joe520.9815122047414
  —Ay, says I148.15087795017584
 Whisky and water on the brain617.6851076546822
  —Come around to Barney Kiernan’s, says Joe970.9959124622183
 I want to see the citizen1988.0762480977246
  —Barney mavourneen’s be it, says I1014.6315776613602
 Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?  —Not a word, says Joe16559.80258563874
 I was up at that meeting in the City Arms6462.031896446224
  —What was that, Joe? says I2302.96257819447
  —Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease19327.722490990545
 I want to give the citizen the hard word about it2789.9224377199107
  So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another31712.888965735667
 Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it12652.863534306347
 Jesus, I couldn’t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber4584.597265836427
 For trading without a licence, says he873.1166575716894
  In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan10875.803220408778
 There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar606.2990153835402
 There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown2891.104362694146
 A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated24281658.6319175
 In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied11165141.281032603
 Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects16387272.022049807
 And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan’s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings89700107.55985852
  And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains4138521.577041061
 Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes10981752020.052017
  I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him41621.6876406579
 Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!  And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun3.694056982446946e+19
  So we turned into Barney Kiernan’s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink17532270124.2249
  —There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause3143008.2073806054
  The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps32056.404782650618
 Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog19401.244973109184
 I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence633051.8040403858
  —Stand and deliver, says he617.3258533662244
  —That’s all right, citizen, says Joe2298.76777877254
 Friends here195.61278468817514
  —Pass, friends, says he600.1602528886829
 But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion4199.120335462685
  —I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork65077.88622428735
  So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:  —Foreign wars is the cause of it86466.17119929238
  And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:  —It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise119858.45653897706
  —Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I1154.7316807771413
 I’ve a thirst on me I wouldn’t sell for half a crown1902.8113858516792
  —Give it a name, citizen, says Joe1711.0714065558336
  —Wine of the country, says he2742.5752907501524
  —What’s yours? says Joe337.7615076798637
  —Ditto MacAnaspey, says I323.66214629981533
  —Three pints, Terry, says Joe811.2997863484572
 And how’s the old heart, citizen? says he1841.5263445465632
 What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?  And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him322981549.72233
  The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero518462.0470602191
 From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_)70550923.73584908
 The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest443291.54598331184
 The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower40313.73083921913
 A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble21327779.857307702
  He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes87606.7055457047
 Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut958.8627924778872
 His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast92549.20856693544
 From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O’Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O’Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O’Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M’Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S37090055150.72687

 A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone200587902.5962199
  So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid132723.82601255082
 O, as true as I’m telling you1162.7185321409622
 A goodlooking sovereign238.68564408030312
  —And there’s more where that came from, says he2315.32635574718
  —Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I817.0572768480505
  —Sweat of my brow, says Joe718.0645568473836
 ’Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze1741.8103629593982
  —I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod’s eye counting up all the guts of the fish11569423.178032143
 Impervious to fear is Rory’s son: he of the prudent soul1982.9475350049847
  —For the old woman of Prince’s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ57117.15383507334
 The pledgebound party on the floor of the house5097.543620694644
 And look at this blasted rag, says he1518.4762503315774

 _The Irish Independent,_ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman’s friend69117.12848367602
 Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent,_ and I’ll thank you and the marriages814274.5745702626
  And he starts reading them out:  —Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne’s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son421842.99663108616
 How’s that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude’s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester2074074.030606005

 Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen121565.9280265
 How’s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How’s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?  —Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose50275352.52277935
 Thanks be to God they had the start of us3183.8267185173772
 Drink that, citizen377.0787363761674
  —I will, says he, honourable person6026.708127354358
  —Health, Joe, says I382.9598602226436
 And all down the form459.91976760855675
  Ah! Ow! Don’t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint17010.885091350563
 Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click8001.515039287225
  And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race1340599509.7361026
  Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney’s snug, squeezed up with the laughing81998.14148877503
 And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran242305.57900719813
 I didn’t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door91137.2137949786
 And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle5566571.137454236
 I thought Alf would split308.19817706328996
  —Look at him, says he2779.105353681081

  —Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds7617.307870179474
  —O hell! says I352.5422197826566
  The bloody mongrel began to growl that’d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs126016.72841834687
  _—Bi i dho husht,_ says he936.8532654556827
  —Who? says Joe190.82292390175795
  —Breen, says Alf385.9198208797518
 He was in John Henry Menton’s and then he went round to Collis and Ward’s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff’s for a lark9914898.352628537

 The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man1686625.732080917
  —When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe4657.833177278085
  —Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up2035.907770483921
 Is that Alf Bergan?  —Yes, says Alf7245.557875129027

  —Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran715.0835122385154
 Is that Bergan?  —Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf6641.988411675707
  Terence O’Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda905967.5812479348
 For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat2725439.2806305587
  Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals10253023.412143117
  But he, the young chief of the O’Bergan’s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze94759.76591109454
 Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop4.578452773770808e+16
  —What’s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?  —What’s that? says Joe183342.02046383335
  —Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino6952.301858804819
 Talking about hanging, I’ll show you something you never saw3083.992897181052
 Hangmen’s letters184.90606455093837
 Look at here178.78103542344343
  So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket42027.57179269457
  —Are you codding? says I376.96367342287436
  —Honest injun, says Alf400.9677755417667
 Read them225.3372400222589
  So Joe took up the letters671.1798871046977
  —Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran715.0835122385154
  So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust445719.9725165044

 He’s no more dead than you are1239.75061513237
  —Maybe so, says Joe540.0367436633064
 They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow1600.2606583862598
  —Paddy? says Alf386.0091877799414
  —Ay, says Joe145.33336502183482
 He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him2774.2243523305506
  —Good Christ! says Alf267.6834594068282
  In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face53423324.67091989
 Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels87705762.1117511
 In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them37856150.6684675
 Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature3278655607.58699
 Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief1853.2802992583252
 Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power46471159.621648654
 It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body6226871.594837658

 O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements1672243.9354897423
 Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good2423928244.710497
 He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known124025.29479881235
  Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction42933.053194538355
  He is gone from mortal haunts: O’Dignam, sun of our morning1309.28474337073
 Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow2786.2408768416544
  —There he is again, says the citizen, staring out13585.25496395493
  —Who? says I148.8509099009586
  —Bloom, says he223.531863688302
 He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes22014.85517541725
  And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again27781.309332959638
  Little Alf was knocked bawways338.1649478063074
 Faith, he was1668.5798553398677
  —Good Christ! says he307.9898713190757
 I could have sworn it was him641.406591725346
  And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence:  —Who said Christ is good?  —I beg your parsnips, says Alf1207163279.3231032
  —Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?  —Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off51479771.04405976
 He’s over all his troubles394.24920850498546
  But Bob Doran shouts out of him1127.3637030175994
  —He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam12688.037056634776
  Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises118408.36444780034
 And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there2534.5650707749724
  —The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character32677.133974020864

 Talking through his bloody hat395.97836766798247
 Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour84797288933.89436
  —The noblest, the truest, says he872.7040173793945
 And he’s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam19549.312740118938
  And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven19124.459709911443
  Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door3679.556211304981
  —Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen26025.518304021443
  So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there52298.349238583
  —O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters63298.8955692842

  —And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe1335.9627883326834
 Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf178376.60456474105
 Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?  So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar3901295916.9660525
 Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake1140.959268352129
  —Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe5014.769833722988
  And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it83337.64963257225
  —They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses430195.73844647716
  And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull26631704.878272697
  In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor5876.605901130145
 Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord92568.50126517979
  So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on4352377991821.2437
  —There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf2137.430694898288
  —What’s that? says Joe172.51856733645386
  —That so? says Joe442.2930830012372
 I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible62253.5019459313
 He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker98977.11019321413
  —Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said16819.188419831095
  —That can be explained by science, says Bloom1628.7981713198792
 It’s only a natural phenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the127328.24369241753
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
  And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon55709.230453418466
  The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis1385366580875257.0
_  So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other86773562124761.55
 Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought85954.00802385416
 Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs4510.98509889957
 And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get72222.61583019285
 So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:  —Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!  Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip102972153706084.05
 Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to bring414654.0839357567
 Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more185141.9023710994
 Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel1885.0456215843221
  And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she’s far from the land4870142.698547823
 And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face62472.02092196523
 Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley28261.058639872095
 And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd that kept the hotel51130513288453.22
 Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat8181.8927710502985
 And Bloom with his _but don’t you see?_ and _but on the other hand_2250050.6371215256
 And sure, more be token, the lout I’m told was in Power’s after, the blender’s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment5915000.529127277
 Phenomenon!  —The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom636991.028391307
  —Ay, ay, says Joe529.3461299156021
  —You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom1083.0852368240803
 What I mean is526.6302929411144
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
  —_Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen951.7793178512702
 _Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us31405.84336504554
  The last farewell was affecting in the extreme631.2580836981892
 From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance72935.14726261422
 The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle39762.56014277215
 A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons191802.02409539375
 A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse2701042.7323986143
 Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents16636.831946866118
 Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth-provoking fashion80611.06015431389
 Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies517959.20186601713
 The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat572021829.8370268
 The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite525214.0799353629
 The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y105400907.56407042

 All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness25115.10076250592
 An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F2416.3927217704295

 as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland’s patron saint57214.49932557304
 In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged45145.94779205992
 The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties211069.33495297132
 The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted2290.3226340692245

, several of whom were bleeding profusely514.1032853338755
 Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses42601853.07718544
 The objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme32144.14807409151
  Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_225468.3679198705
 He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man29620.929151397802
 The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable160451042832.99332
 It was exactly seventeen o’clock282.754442669818
 The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi25383455.335640762
 The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication79942263.34331763
 Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously125788.92743771094
 As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office2457851.710680716
 On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim3119953817.107649
 The housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution10645.551763693753
 Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem255505678777833.66
 The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake67598425.94673997
 The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_6370.063398640597
 Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach39058.868573491
 She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park924237570.1633573
 She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment972284237.1987842
 That monster audience simply rocked with delight339.0384459551486
 But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time6300.622389253701
 A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself542492.3583750466
 A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot402433006.54135525
 Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds13402267446598.951
 With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:  —God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart45216667.77297122
 Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way471683.67910608364
  So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland211181396572.62738
 Antitreating is about the size of it1250.6855507333862
 Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint64500.844639253744
 And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don’t be talking51106413025635.25
 Ireland sober is Ireland free298.43155899863825
 And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of160809.70928761625
 And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt204266.7934084111
  So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me536328.8285461202
 I’d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog72824.54398712018
 Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him4409.3116621359695
  —Afraid he’ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering6449.3543275414295
  —No, says I323.2159714625212
  So he calls the old dog over1758.3999657453708
  —What’s on you, Garry? says he2595.773136912687
  Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera7245464.417027492
 Such growling you never heard as they let off between them1773.0456967747948
 Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that507491.90127505176
 Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws236022.6850365731
  All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry570217192.6405859
 The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse248550.61818452497
 Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards3747806.936405907
 We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D441613.0457842132
 O37.63733684633052
 points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye130111645.67182559
 We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication3966034.403248974
 The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught289024.66339440324
 Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour49171.96780761868
       The curse of my curses      Seven days every day      And seven dry Thursdays      On you, Barney Kiernan,      Has no sup of water      To cool my courage,      And my guts red roaring      After Lowry’s lights1233612.3746476937
  So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off338546.66272833996
 And Joe asked him would he have another2160.1502617363194
  —I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there’s no ill feeling91991.48770634457
  Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking672.0067522627397
 Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators93134.01484770437
 Entertainment for man and beast353.0758091291998
 And says Joe:  —Could you make a hole in another pint?  —Could a swim duck? says I41275.97767964341
  —Same again, Terry, says Joe608.9413555265734
 Are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he54593.596227240276
  —Thank you, no, says Bloom5499.251112008026
 As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam’s1239119.1199082118
 Martin asked me to go to the house14678.710418472796
 You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy84809163.16231383
  —Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is landed193841.02931596676
 So the wife comes out top dog, what?  —Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers21278551.45324092
  —Whose admirers? says Joe306.6849212171026
  —The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom5163.331335634408
  Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act2218123000581.668
 He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court836614.6935303609

 O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery1432.3254015739274
  So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her48941778472.86298
 Choking with bloody foolery263.01214407847493
 And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that3128.43281528939
 Shake hands, brother358.0224082004904
 You’re a rogue and I’m another564.872188762935
  —Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour702323881.5793092
 But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness11047.1112221006
  —No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup100989188.79501094
  —Then suffer me to take your hand, said he7331.709839873693
 The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech11743993.281475363
 Boosed at five o’clock272.6882830171011
 Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A3184.0708649310995
 Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups399093.12056683155
 And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging21867906548.26175
 And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another57541018.06050138
 _How is your testament? Have you got an old testament?_ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what1221329.128179124
 Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady750619637.8709102
 Jack Mooney’s sister246.542130906901
 And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples2869.787883024095
 Gob, Jack made him toe the line626.8519194225555
 Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus, he’d kick the shite out of him51429.76367188292
  So Terry brought the three pints501.3105957813049
  —Here, says Joe, doing the honours10681.451618753645
 Here, citizen259.1224880631903
  —_Slan leat_, says he949.5644708247737
  —Fortune, Joe, says I328.5661162725331
 Good health, citizen503.7093509492882
  Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already22154.82758284866

  —Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe6084.602397861505
  —Friend of yours, says Alf847.3700988525457
  —Nannan? says Joe247.4200780822169
 The mimber?  —I won’t mention any names, says Alf10549.394249716515
  —I thought so, says Joe1148.528268738097
 I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M5036.758692545688

  —Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own265666.9454665191
  So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue715422061.8595713
 Because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard1991.2441233823513

 The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park22418.146649647068
  Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham208.53889484292154
 Nat110.45701638602429
): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?  Mr Allfours (Tamoshant231896842.805906

  Mr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte230.0555895383163

  Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman’s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)  Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question2672895.160849907

  —Is that really a fact? says Alf1337.6653872465838
  —Yes, says Bloom199.5150911222413
 That’s well known229.74516950990363
 Did you not know that?  So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that21232605.293190144
 And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent exercise was bad61886.42450530576

  A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O’Ciarnain’s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of _Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race63564447829.085625
 The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions60332.16977438389
 After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers6963961.201483326
 The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages85814859.54666412
 L46.28863557191641
 Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself498296716008.0501
 The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it37476.34616727952
 His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions237502546.72923264

  —Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?  —No, says Joe423733.91305068345

  —Who? Blazes? says Joe381.42245129455733
  And says Bloom:  —What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye459554.82480105554

  It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns8149.892036306441
 Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft57685.19151454969
 The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions905.433797989021
 The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett’s jaw549744.1379414727

 The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime2904553.2724512927
 It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it7212.873634866464
 The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high592.3278382579249
 The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch4319.603485927005
 After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him flat2041083.2362402643
 It was a knockout clean and clever760.7260688948058
 Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight535889.8421120989

 Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge3293116.4975016215
  And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:  —A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?  —Yes, your worship414265516.0458015

  And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law27649569769.240204
 There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another225620946160.3269
 And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer4624.661945048333
 And he sat him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin194021303.53686446
 And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true1.4741066149493608e+19
 And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book181832605.874681
 And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness2912222.397650841
 And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received97536.43125384075
 And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor265048.67087691644
  —Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs61068.223638674
  So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford9892182.369180162
 And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all20596.832054296257

 Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?  So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast114490672.62317058
  —Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?  O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael5.162309408780834e+18

  —Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen1573.0818095242023
 To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name2188525.136849172

_  And says John Wyse:  —Full many a flower is born to blush unseen13277.545277404075
  And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:  —_Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!_  He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods1219698161271.2864
  —What’s up with you, says I to Lenehan21818.794874038675
 You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner10228.609054776347

 Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world99789887432750.58

 What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?  —As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land1084654724.5216987

  The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley435034.3406689436
 Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence76826577598.0584
 The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral119533566.93768863
 Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service20980443.35159158
 On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots551813.3570896675
 Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest10461.492384905376
  —And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen1689.2792984232372

  —And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh860064.717309997
 Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the O’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself765341995.0914569
 And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius53990250643.80467

 Hell upon earth it is461.1397369056298
 A fellow writes that calls himself _Disgusted One_697.3259554746905
  So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun312013010.6256974
  —A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on the breech458413.62286546046
  And says John Wyse:  —’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance24425.070030858875

  —And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it85480.0878238479
 The unfortunate yahoos believe it334.59416496395306
  They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid11591031080137.299
  —But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere6234.030150092076
 I mean wouldn’t it be the same here if you put force against force?  Didn’t I tell you? As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living239301285.3733124

 We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us2870.939448499686

 We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese1484.4607429212847
 Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa83646.75196373924

  —And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s dead?  Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper2.4549305196773156e+18

  Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about152532.76314431182
  —Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it1586285.93442277
 Perpetuating national hatred among nations274.697465231117
  —But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse9637.43979819176

  —What is it? says John Wyse1190.3472239937867
  —A nation? says Bloom417.6871124225614
 A nation is the same people living in the same place11044.058579656157
  —By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m living in the same place for the past five years35183724.74813094
  So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:  —Or also living in different places34865523.83257815

  The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner9894549.6694634

  —Here you are, citizen, says Joe808.0980002499164
 Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words8618.56530263042
  The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration105406.44185172368
 No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill18037005005.808163
 The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides10537369.77780094
 Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland’s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh’s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde’s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun’s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch’s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury’s Hotel, S703573544864.9141
 Patrick’s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley’s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal’s Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time7378857881.087209
  —Show us over the drink, says I1514.8937207529552
 Which is which?  —That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman3327263.90960482
  —And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted157166.03714940883

 Force, hatred, history, all that1500.2670437908637
 That’s not life for men and women, insult and hatred1669.7357398507968

 More power, citizen303.2111280797414
  —Hurrah, there, says Joe1304.359844810498
  —The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen18529.87743314227
  And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle953.4927711977108
  —We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket9277.150962363476
 What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting England?  —What’s that? says Joe1480181041.6619782
  So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:  —A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions16018651266.69144
 The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor2.046339800131451e+17
 The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands28384542788.14391
  —Widow woman, says Ned640.8679168506902
 I wouldn’t doubt her260.0290344969155
 Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would4721.647427922048

 And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly656.7783829573268

 It’s only initialled: P260.2546266504219

 Did you read that report by a man what’s this his name is?  —Casement, says the citizen116129.43501344396
 He’s an Irishman232.62151201378518
  —Yes, that’s the man, says J4460.985498937442

  —I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers6240.949322893601
  —Who? says I148.8509099009586
  —Bloom, says he223.531863688302
 The courthouse is a blind443.1178777505626
 He had a few bob on _Throwaway_ and he’s gone to gather in the shekels111111.14212903887
  —Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?  —That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan2502139.72021946
 I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip1152764.6901567364
 Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on27669.587918026904
 He’s the only man in Dublin has it1524.1283488060856
 A dark horse382.2872515653858
  —He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe1416.573733216009
  —Mind, Joe, says I409.5615479268963
 Show us the entrance out416.4796333562525
  —There you are, says Terry1792.097762047282
  Goodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort857.2983507944062
 So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery’s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she’s better_ or _she’s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there’s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos5.7376107237502566e+25
  So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries4444650858.53419

  —Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse2020.2819805171566
 And there’s the man now that’ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham146445.3605355091
  Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king’s expense543327001.2896105
  Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys752.1241956977475
  —Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party17838.030293895434
  Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard3999.787222662871
  —Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow13791.959788185135
  —Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked1565.3774640756037
 Look to our steeds318.1340872647957
 And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it2264.8553286990664
  —Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder37941.74514016638
 I know not what to offer your lordships769.0550798031182
  —How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun?  An instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage4407181.926447631
  —Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly11897.64164583562
 An you be the king’s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught15903.770011982448
 The king’s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me17457.932069229013
  —Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect10211.132360449821
 Hast aught to give us?  Mine host bowed again as he made answer:  —What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?  —Gadzooks! cried the last speaker5979047277.3196745
 That likes me well266.57468049818465
 Pistachios!  —Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance3762.557079626364
 A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’Tis a merry rogue5478.264311487434
  So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom622.9719687087663
  —Where is he? says Lenehan1193.8178470319438
 Defrauding widows and orphans238.08664665216483
  —Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?  —That’s so, says Martin11719204.91157546
 Or so they allege282.1701995709086
  —Who made those allegations? says Alf420.67000270010635
  —I, says Joe342.8656639046557
 I’m the alligator212.44626394304706
  —And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like the next fellow?  —Why not? says J2668046.261314631
 J14.764669680725877
, when he’s quite sure which country it is984.803908177033

  —Who is Junius? says J398.3398674653792
 J14.764669680725877
  —We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian4276.692184214177
  —He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system27049111.3533093
 We know that in the castle1997.3397292757488
  —Not at all, says Martin1993.1142916926478
 Only namesakes180.99809928111586
 His name was Virag, the father’s name that poisoned himself3823.043755800962
 He changed it by deedpoll, the father did1787.623589599197
  —That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen1164.6806049396973
 Island of saints and sages!  —Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin41014.064921556484

  —Yes, says J115.18045360835865
 J14.764669680725877
, and every male that’s born they think it may be their Messiah8612.18118714695
 And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he’s a father or a mother214762.54175652112
  —Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan1523.802118549786
 I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered56856.396686784225
  —_En ventre sa mère_, says J1716.4398079892508
  —Do you call that a man? says the citizen4787.287030992662
  —I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe35566.36148747931
  —Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power4714.197333401973
  —And who does he suspect? says the citizen1003.9829010789375
 One of those mixed middlings he is814.2955863067731
 Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses260921.04328011992
 Do you know what I’m telling you? It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea40972853.840591535

  And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S6.177564008742396e+18

 And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein1000821099763731.8
 And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers53916.5444865231
  —_Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini452.4348200255849

_  —_Et cum spiritu tuo451.7968968656383
_  And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:  —_Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum214566061.14259377

  I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry5531386.103578073

  And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car14958047815.5162
  —Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey19218.064349515473
  The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard398691.9837535101
 A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair9771507507.78959
 Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters7974.648628609146
  But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him16417346183478.668
  —Let me alone, says he670.096933886567
  And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:  —Three cheers for Israel!  Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake and don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself6749993179.655182

  And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her:  —Eh, mister!

  A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters)137790808.60799137
 The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality3982.4647907380067
 An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob1410603878.5348558
 The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_, followed immediately by _Rakóczsy’s March_4028187.8244555504
 Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M’Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom182176265.9635236
 Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light178516656577.94394
 _Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra!_ Gone but not forgotten1065.654996449576
  Gob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s royal theatre:  —Where is he till I murder him?  And Ned and J226423524361.84253

  But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other way and off with him63370.90537521732
  —Hold on, citizen, says Joe619.7770779250915
 Stop!  Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly12276.854887855312
 Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he’d have left him for dead92008.13341168033

 The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street4016428.9108810285
  The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect702.1003536311763
 The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas52134735.35029157
 The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch1805196.1746172353
 All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive1625581768.0744424
 From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character5503.918629616733
 An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale36153903355761.61
 Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west9710.008692159578
 Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst45748119788.3095
 The work of salvage, removal of _débris,_ human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T175512.80717938047

 Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he’d remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting381665502.1681398
 The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses5050.9977175037075
 What? O, Jesus, he did9082.536475457766
 And he let a volley of oaths after him1184.2259381379558
  —Did I kill him, says he, or what?  And he shouting to the bloody dog:  —After him, Garry! After him, boy!  And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb60596532873185.45
 Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you1285592.3846048457
  When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven82796.37193947834
 And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him22373835.22999809
 And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah! Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai!_ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe’s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel148442907749.17783
     [ 13 ]   The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace3812.1932031468427
 Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea1.3842614227014454e+16
  The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly139082.81918925117
 Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H16549130889.018541

 S29.001662258684078
 Belleisle_ printed on both375.92584236661725
 For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them249302.2055061807
 They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long231723.49705409235
 And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight53319.91589136838
 He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words108506.94411898319
 Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin16712.15419036723
  —Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said944.4885642058505
 Say out big, big428.7992470386832
  And baby prattled after her:  —A jink a jink a jawbo12076.145133190184
  Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on166181715.673912
 What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib1156462.9407655378
 None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey2942.5151748591015
 A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme4070849.233775527
 And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother2888.807955174833
  But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky22086.628604619676
 Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule6121.59079010343
 The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had12614511.89906572
 But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too13636883.73793025
 Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends12901.334159660624
  —Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively1870.9240562441507
 At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand18053.20230166836
 Wait till I catch you for that636.6868885344062
  His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins8807.977355119701
 And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure7352.735157170587
 His little man-o’-war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit5332697.902395459
 Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition79745077.45621225
  —Nasty bold Jacky! she cried533.756836679102
  She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:  —What’s your name? Butter and cream?  —Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman806714.1326521175
 Is Cissy your sweetheart?  —Nao, tearful Tommy said1530.4388613204883
  —Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried757.6680615166551
  —Nao, Tommy said246.3822764450189
 I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart501.8931018045229
 Gerty is Tommy’s sweetheart211.1301036722529
  —Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears2059.5034112095377
  Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes1859890.9478405844
  But who was Gerty?  Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see4453914.222537557
 She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell59931.82725724995
 Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling74281094.63896106
 Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either18907516.78708187
 Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again898388677134.7158
 No34.48566147928474
 Honour where honour is due335.8967570391417
 There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep19511.137694537912
 Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her17048245426.664158
 Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist23357669.52528105
 Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows16409.02942988203
 Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive957.1983214502932
 It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it34321721.25406671
 Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one4922559.539112242
 But Gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair705.2189894072015
 It was dark brown with a natural wave in it1558.0832070383003
 She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth3586280.8702256465
 And just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal2639377.5051542534
  For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes3463.3748982699467
 She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue4735.464590711614
 Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent8804.879284897826
 The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning562568.0573632553
 As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window6242371.818172964
 Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W1746745780.4189043
 E23.137154072392757
 Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university1586.3879225765966
 Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core16967.28250200448
 Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time7678.382051178203
 They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph195461.42202085094
 But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden1.1062283700074327e+20
  Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out2624535.1653102674
 A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady’s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection309380075638.723
 She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone239305.63655986075
 All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny3153830.344872359
 Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep159812461.06604308
 Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops333753.7186286019
 As for undies they were Gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things1661597621527123.0
 She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a Friday4.0558162078848154e+18
  And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time28749.192539393982
 Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror161802258970.5457
 You are lovely, Gerty, it said1514.8236145649657
 The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful1431.3555765261096
 Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain324.8047914855974
 Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T140580.08385284757
 C23.414818345807948
 D30.697193884868067
 (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be3240717.7710295785
 He was too young to understand1020.4321082122826
 He would not believe in love, a woman’s birthright4505.35327924416
 The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips22057863.48878112
 He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments865269290.1256766
 Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men222653.2231207305
 But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over77712.71685187232
 No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss481870973083.715
 It would be like heaven607.116903264757
 For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve901.2642051680745
 With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward12260128.644038094
  And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be764523.5844023157
 Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November3571981.3892812952
 She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess41007.523453813825
 Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses7955795688452429.0
 He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes517795788886218.25
  Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight79031427.32086007
 But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please155726174629.15
 The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies4854292.0948597975
 Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him6086653.247829994
  —You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said813.9828005553974
 It’s my ball207.99448523691333
  But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day9358325.32628806
  —Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss1022.2594250250802
  And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin3969841.161446538
 But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him17930.77817963009
  —I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t say1347842.5442142307
  —On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily474.3254661457981
  Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said2672675297.9063945
 But not a pin cared Ciss443.2639636990465
  —Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose170724.43224194957
 Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at him292091.75261894264
  Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls364.27557034956794
 You had to laugh at her sometimes1153.0667413629412
 For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White5333823788.431559
 That was just like Cissycums632.9946769119778
 O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette1728590.2734224186
 There was none to come up to her for fun2509.9476572480185
 But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome1405492.6018683927
  And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ54309.22681573158
 It was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S6753.050474376915
 J14.764669680725877
, rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament3159.4167290369746
 They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins103852447770.80193
 How sad to poor Gerty’s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none2180148.0340127377
 But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days3908.86100565618
 Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low65554596312963.78
  And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful3266.886221029589
 And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk26364846.165568743
 Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke8058668512444.531
 No-one would have thought the end was so near1588.1917211118246
 Now he was laid to rest513.0799953795482
 And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home223125986447111.03
  A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold1486073.4290726704
 And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff36037285.21634005
 Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways2410.484395674875
 It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window2183783237630.099
 You could see there was a story behind it4513.109934927653
 The colours were done something lovely368.4113280695748
 She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat107039.55011964952
 She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant572310561.4249262
  The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks8839724.939883366
 Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball139251.80231779232
 The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock1196732.3990796432
 The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed731642553.9383165
  —If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said1006.4839707643102
  Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip371.51226932638264
 A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle1285365047.1832154
 Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking210483.71675616427
 She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks20435.491406278554
 Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen1769328769.8932664
  Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose2135342018.939662
 And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her238141198763.35388
  The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers2918.5469398857986
 Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air2948.59870682742
 Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa348170561.3733472
 Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa1115.7150892860616
  And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said24566306080.022976
  —Haja ja ja haja239.97095529111502
  Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him484835839.37488943
 Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:  —Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa24665.625051107254
  And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks916.1592567747633
 It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased342263623.63497293
  Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins50575205.351593204
 She gazed out towards the distant sea935.680422491962
 It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft12516810218032.021
 And while she gazed her heart went pitapat582.1101350041286
 Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look525646.7813062579
 His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul17611.886030705755
 Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer14620.003151593066
 She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting258990694071105.1
 He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face3458526.284886091
 She would have given worlds to know what it was10994.917689362423
 He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down374425790.69528323
 She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away326501.9301293653
 Here was that of which she had so often dreamed6192.040235840405
 It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else4623289.715388392
 The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him523942.5684239052
 If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not9579668.573876394
 Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her63932.85291020491
 There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm474.4444197814969
 She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past3151150024.225143
 Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone10331988.985689417
  Refuge of sinners213.6895455620135
 Comfortress of the afflicted328.1123773660837
 _Ora pro nobis_284.2186015762316
 Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart6094358.739269165
 Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down1895929581.4260464
 He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic45792711.13845519
 He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word4.437752375081283e+20
 He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place1.238445180889956e+16
  The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it185093.73297187733
 Little monkeys common as ditchwater300.6303878034476
 Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them397381.08057481586
 And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned289946.9542502952
  —Jacky! Tommy!  Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out4239738.446312799
 She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it69691885154.88516
 She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible7.375209924700674e+18
 It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble3307468.538832739
 _Tableau!_ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness162897.37157150707
  Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_1.669484553306613e+26
 Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself3137920042654.852
  Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature54087406740.52761
 Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness6484460.825211774
 You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that84842.01854376588
 She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve51886.43323081676
 She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes1941737.300614447
 He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey1221.805729797396
 Her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose14672871.176713618
  Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby1046512.6895862643
 Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers1435028.688867849
 And she said to Gerty:  —A penny for your thoughts27606.165042131364
  —What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth3805.7809516799502
 I was only wondering was it late702.0419853988569
  Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late6340102.845581805
 And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again4598006.789783193
 But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early27296.009410767176
  —Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum14099.140716220503
  So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church405232865.0155118
 Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself86998.82271187013
 One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure73445092.61960445
  Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set2903941062228.392
 His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones507335.12768045085
 Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order41995.21126985855
 It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets517509213524.9744
 She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon13327358709.38594
 His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine8175.947242875924
 If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face105823.29415448949
 It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it36230.20159211991
  Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over1.0380605003715075e+24
 Gerty winced sharply198.46774836290263
 A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable2159.383208144489
 It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was192854.62465038756
 Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of400584.21865604067
 She had loved him better than he knew1470.4762634119288
 Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears75978978.06217872
  —O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up76562.69059293886
 I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year1664.8891915581826
  Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily13059.216290927481
 There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with324274.5555692589
 As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces634028792.5246111
 And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot500377.99737323716
 Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it1499349863282235.0
  Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior30965532.571995173
 And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib157634260629.2123
  —O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss586.4275177841945
 He has his bib destroyed433.7912403955296
  The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights7930.919957635486
  Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands7121211852373273.0
  How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry1967052762.996637
 And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales54424060662416.81
 For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of788.5389542534765
 She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean1557214012.7817564
 It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs37363691842165.125
 _Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it140098335717357.77
 But it must end, she felt733.8777676082507
 If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her42274.000975315466
 Love laughs at locksmiths234.2397084483725
 She would make the great sacrifice581.7381567257099
 Her every effort would be to share his thoughts823.8874788724614
 Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness17334.41948710694
 There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind14096523889.297226
 But even if—what then? Would it make a very great difference? From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled83687.13201418036
 She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station28530939.872060508
 No, no: not that1147.5305324713106
 They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess299712.86517762166
 Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall65674.90155557728
 She thought she understood446.11025451476684
 She would try to understand him because men were so different1693.3110015086424
 The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes12178.068965108087
 Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide8017644241.954458
 Nothing else mattered242.07254841140417
 Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free1793.6707128143476
  Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:  —O, look, Cissy!  And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple2235690001462911.8
  —It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said428.4492267905918
  —Come on, Gerty, Cissy called1395.584556042637
 It’s the bazaar fireworks301.5351019472983
  But Gerty was adamant283.0824936824725
 She had no intention of being at their beck and call1290.2275636795987
 If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was53341.501746544855
 The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling1433.0609356988984
 She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her118258.58690183719
 Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his87848.16485191416
 At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips8764993.77531468
 His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her2315.3583024754653
 She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed6.674536821624127e+22
 But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips22023369.14637648
 Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did34329380375772.742
  And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark1.0341155094592802e+16
 And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking2.466327518388012e+33
 She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages1231811520.7627647
 And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!  Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent87506860707838.8
 Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl228738.8959463737
 He was leaning back against the rock behind743.3668505977422
 Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes12744.213287044226
 What a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered37210456441864.375
 Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no4476.458950598453
 That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell16017853.10849234
  Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried:  —Gerty! Gerty! We’re going863495.2523428288
 Come on203.19261094678942
 We can see from farther up550.4493604786776
  Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses3455.408346700471
 She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back148934.22331803673
 Wonder if he’s too far to625.697707309752
 She rose178.94448420574915
 Was it goodbye? No327.4963813967829
 She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve8374952.368545934
 She drew herself up to her full height1490.2992843597235
 Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face545989.2859276872
 She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted95696.54573996471
  Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman348827.37995224656
 It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed17075.736111159975
 She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell was42956.04155809428

  Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa!  Universally that person’s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind’s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature’s incorrupted benefaction1856918902699.251
 For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature’s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution’s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?

  The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed795781.0163526236
 She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman’s birth38586.271309572985
 Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house399618.8840329861
 The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid301019124.7342245

  And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat217673.1573284226
 And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon3280.413404471951
 And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice600309081760.5203
 And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there144132.36101976858
 And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile296010.5315676765
 Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility31191.562543208875
 But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle1885442.4392921198
 And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery167627.01231278377
  And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment2270530.4303396265
 And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously562224.4432506905
 And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles379315.1654206466
 And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer9477.026429501844
 And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress41752.59076843466
 And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain27614660.16450541
 And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead3867750.5928075886
  And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each16354.82426093334
 And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile8609174.363113685
 And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile28466.840419582226
 Thanked be Almighty God245.35572543321723
  This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast15260764.531360522
 Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now11778227.703308983
 Meseems it dureth overlong215.59070377876813
 And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently1295169458.1842418
 But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long372641.7217641983
 And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next3872.509974701632
 Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness81313039895.40007
 And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup17151438964.105742
 Woman’s woe with wonder pondering370.67090073680305
  Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might16628.24092684937
 There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold3.1648739336730116e+16
 But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow119022.61392563532
 And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner14333962.238154551
 Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave3778.67692967303
  For they were right witty scholars426.5119156849811
 And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case)64017501609.70502
 And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die103530895.38169692
 And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy2336447.2304727044
 A redress God grant259.2460186087229
 This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die94672.16646191181
 In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack358438.35391151474
 Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved114259958.92620382
 To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk6521.5656179362795
 Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire37818.54053111529
 But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief147499295.84915158
 We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we2323.350759371313
 Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends680.6413916029919
 But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead51938702.80422152
 Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do5989873681.352512
 Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever56335394.61938821
 Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides68240283858274.5
 He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded553002407.1853168
 A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions1113029834399.182
 Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons600445350.1307648
  But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny124150247.6886072
 And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores4.214734259881438e+17
  About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray200002343.70615757

 And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ26713913.694430694
 They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore8982.238900427341

 No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin2149196828630.5955

 And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word5031.652206730886

  Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard43308202503837.93
 It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred7.176636630777331e+18
 In Horne’s house rest should reign663.4357079570435
  To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days85533068.40659039
 Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership4145073151.1815953
 But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin190637.98659196685
 Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided20784224175.302986

 Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour2890121.230731107
 But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead123566.29178540806

 He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon1116273817288013.1
  But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words? No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away1031908.8467130425
 And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either5208583.566614393
 But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle383272.9612859876
 Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard? Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done)3936156244.5552864
 For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show1758705691.4997628
 And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law28280874.567201123
 Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence2.1046116183138305e+26
  This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her54277050.430000715
 For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild164659767766509.8
 So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer214667.4609074584

 But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came72034738887527.94

 Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue4.348247542095798e+17
 ’Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king’s bible15581231.716034861

 In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how5575925490439.311
  With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk1522077979789.2168
 He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat471229.3084385807
 To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip440085026.3571189
 He took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides1529458237.9949274
 The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale37860.22306416055
 Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague5459440.928813372
 But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it344868.67073704064
 There’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset5380773053.160964
 _Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too1005410.5293543708
 One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge9417257286.442398
 He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him7355034.384138141
 What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he355447672.4871314
 I can scarce believe ’tis so bad, says he1831.6018758518994
 And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street13549045.188403443
 I question with you there, says he1230.1866765721281
 More like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue1565.2137960495224
 Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns54933928861.74408
 Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing3388.442798165649
 He’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s Irish, says he17316.057183214863
 I conceive you, says Mr Dixon2818.8815147691075
 It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose2006856.5371579677
 True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock6665698445.14982
 He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains74739988.92945144
 What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself10377980.16483146
 So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly16097565.219153307
 But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland434676754275089.06
 Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content5071401160457.123
 By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture538081.4647028021
 Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground672177342318222.4
 And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders2866129327.3484592
 There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in his matters, says he2353944377.983143
 I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me809825.0461184334
 But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show5.874922408372641e+16
 After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name47029577.81585174
 Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat3453079644808249.5
 In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt26250.90738999133
 They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America6.167782624032728e+16
 Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:  _—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed2980123.1709551746
  A man’s a man for a’ that968.4655752531017
_  Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars11099819604.117716
 Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on14421380.277509574
 Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan2908950.4069549255
 Fertiliser and Incubator201.51716950593752
 Lambay Island_230.86926390903156
 His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed124362760.32778983
 Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon179022.76560331864
 I make no doubt it smacks of wenching556.4766957201056
 Come, be seated, both525.5733072146959
 ’Tis as cheap sitting as standing365.57409359916335
 Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired5172485415.94034
 It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep9984793844779.354
 To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party425097845.23846585
 He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural149376168.9365463
 Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains340782.6505326907
 The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man430735.64267554495
 For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies9180348.30209984
 After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it494114.5156717748
 They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald10895450.946232213
 His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle441467.94576405303
 Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck349160839523.7693
  Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced7024888.552522799
 The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour3507620.467001822
 Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place3.813651575205663e+17
 For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a bastard157066847.65359318
 This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight22303.66969222728
 The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber38976.13344387801
  Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it1.2513638852186694e+16
 _Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_11438.67564564545
 That you may and very opportunely550.4987716395427
 There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity784.3759171614706
 But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things19997667930.71599
 With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein368784148.8973066
 Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever155710308125302.16
 I declare, I was never so touched in all my life7276.165085287448
 God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours407355.0647101861
 A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again263175.23078522587
 Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years3407393.63720607
 But indeed, sir, I wander from the point6719.2264539976395
 How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys637.016085535861

 Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse15370.398035018085
 But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting85944796387.69073
 Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak22634501323.474163
 A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world58561.78031770358
 Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch1496.6907387584195

 My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment939669105935780.9
 The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath421670611.1149279

5.498166464669896
 But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge37824.5069672959
  Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company998593396.9046459
 The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry31901857.012621235
 Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled2522.7698022201994
 A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you1715.9622786769514

 Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I’m all of a wibbly wobbly11835906.137903761
 Why, you’re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way3240780.2428064095
 I knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her7456.7758820965955
 The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward2865875.173955637
 Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy3807663.400523738
 I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth28078759.1711808
 I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast14177897.52792686
 I cannot away with them409.2000789639145
 What? Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours? And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne243394679507.6774
 Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door8429.06462911904
 A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath64088370790.04014
 Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart2236528179.5605226
  To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity14625818.169983763
 The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf159388326.43948638
 But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin5117656085461.336
 To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat10872043202.216082
 Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions4643181245.149039
 To conclude, while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being33899973015.802
  Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers43424374634.84417
 The dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron1322068.4211532471
 I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her2143923464.5847077
 I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon2995.060295918253
 ’Slife, I’ll be round with you1183.6860441640101
 I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her22973.69081107426
 All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household341937495.1251306
 Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest209636508.57419106
 But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together689425.3912544112
  But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so3.467857790205239e+26
 Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate115844.79309720258
 He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic5398544579423.091
 It ill becomes him to preach that gospel608.4671984704117

 If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him21598.184188478946
 His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce1337.393615563865
 The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative1240315127.0278118
  The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born1318240.826747567
 When he had betaken himself to the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues10428093488.203726
 In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain23871.187603984672
 The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent12145.94274478622
 Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations4.5416290450473957e+27
 The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation62469203718.48027
 The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born4595535.486722153
 The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human1099657.5205148289
 An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses380756625.96152246
 The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived1003.1580333769855
 It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man4004982.479734854
 Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined104576125.00112729

 No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds352875.8401681902

 Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins7.752021025078891e+16
 The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before316433040412.72
 But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist51137.97454706218
 Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons4462.715321508606
 Who can say? The wise father knows his own child2385.5373885071594

  The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived381983.0354490894
 A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars4908.491468911434
 She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal1422.269893323678
 Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull13209.372892643776

 Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_49406.69421199238

 And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo290322.22744382074
 And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin437670.29938038177
 It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant116684.98398140579
 How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer10270319.364287218
 It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus220553094.06817964
  Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee’s time24353.33789096823
 You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said7992.20570641657
 Why think of them? If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life50693829.357009225
 He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent1287.528662053012
 That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father940148.7311012591
 All who wish you well hope this for you801.2351992904635

 O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him31041.902449491987
 Have no fear280.27742097531575
 The young man’s face grew dark436.1487590373399
 All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss242429.6672650109
 He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart12410.500219682384

 Even Phyllis could not contain herself433.63208976423357
 She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her1223256.287039514
 All was lost now321.7868808162942
 Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones1711.63800178739
 Juno, she cried, I am undone7077.861791551529
 But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook12636.456301191545

 Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh35369.295485578994
 She is not the filly that she was4263.259227181634
 Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another2692.5355308216544
 By gad, sir, a queen of them9489.538061362386
 Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said41799.1608169479
 How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it910219.8932249256
 The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us18507.473540743147
 In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge150152.49323865902
 But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close57646.39313239157
 A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril15819.430003803507
 She is more taking then345.17998713559643
 Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together53143.69465455275
 And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field227123.65808904322
 Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page7444462.3272628635
 The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her260109.44629163627
 When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries7735.3168879932655
 But he had been kind1792.1705141330392
 In going by he had blessed us847.9880916824007
 The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said897.5037408525866
 If I had poor luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely5414.606385907499
 He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label391013.45172243845
 Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence594.4687862146999
 His soul is far away491.17855549464787
 It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born11198.177574405721
 Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods21768.0208205412
 Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law1580185.132531638
 The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation2286512.1563133225
  However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all40007511.318439536
 During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance78431086286.06651
 He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn2830792198.4834676
 Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place5.483496968789996e+17
  The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life9514.413134036677
 Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity436.90818196010343
 The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital29874.21898934444
 The high hall of Horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic83468.06958848673
 A gallant scene in truth it made532.7835316216974
 Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway845857.2319988343
 There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom35309.63424668753
 Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden113107.9344326544
 The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan1061521.498199665
 Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come1641135497069.372
  It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S31471.134827473415
 Dedalus’ (Div154.01874272127546
 Scep110.45701638602429
) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods1679.26635215951
 Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena1740.4027383683633
 The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can271912.918175306
 There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first problem submitted by Mr L89988.36008384467
 Bloom (Pubb131.50728638563922
 Canv110.45701638602429
) regarding the future determination of sex377.5265925249668
 Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element5581987335937234.0
 The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality2431.654491024316
 It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways5018804.94565214
 Mr M156.43184859415484
 Mulligan (Hyg216.88484777510996

 by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust403.7846935075892
 These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race874142506.7387697
 Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner9375010984.501083
 Mr J155.91171953115318
 Crotthers (Disc223.7290415848064
 Bacc159.88885980833746
) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide64191138.95927525
 Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative128652.56180555534
 In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions37146130.60348162
 An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V869.9074246118872
 Lynch (Bacc190.77199915821365
 Arith163.44048197260335
) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained3167592959.6961813
 Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet’s words, give us pause116287989.51386411
 Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest829082707880961.4
 Mr S156.91699820748556
 Dedalus’ (Div154.01874272127546
 Scep110.45701638602429
) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to15091757453.34665
 For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother878187556.5726253

 At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered1047385.7078018911
  Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy _accouchement1849.8631833097406

 All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped3349.494672015589
 She had176.40685370937427
 She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy3794.262601768874
 Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene44045.0121523817
 Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband34817021204.11333
 And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God’s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces7256553.200174489
 He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch7259337.510081847
 O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days10195664.506978095
 God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose14180843425232.666
 And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here1164.2759986500446
 No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina1711.3185548633278
 And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest576686789.4101292

 Well done, thou good and faithful servant!  There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait14967589.417083962
 He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise931375.7029910085
 Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful11566645.44045312
  The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life136869209.0771104
 A scene disengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures5257496.45207967
 A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock622586217.4079759
 And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit4268288024.4042997

 But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word3130646546.3174114

 His (Stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman’s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral261259095099520.25
 But how to get there was the rub3050.734990775277
 For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned733721.6021225723
 So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e1222161248.850571
d30.697193884868067
ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found30929.130361367977
 Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s9019710327275.996
 But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice201342015463356.88
  This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did8878841.568519525
 So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance4834457891822.552
 So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey38345864.36930192
 As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back5096850.635496382
 They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station25943411831.939278
 Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke’s the baker’s it is said267187.18709228653
  _En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out2.475038183205457e+19
 Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about1.2487654764999528e+16
 The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot33821049590.46577
 Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes109737453.79292506
 Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything278237.1783425615
 You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £40678030.01864074
 s29.001662258684078
 d30.697193884868067
 into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically1138380446678.1685
 Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs824280.8654414789
  —And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind268835.3516531799
  Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps21026744.979016468
 Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox362816212.21623844
 He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father’s, Gumley3348667.1535525774
 To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge7327.161565195646
  —Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said918.4141432661123
  A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling:  —Night!  Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment253203.80637716295
 Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least2656315.6213949993
  Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice1158398.068649056
 Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise6712.766739525809
 He was the eldest son of inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer709177.277033518
 His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot28425.226963505156
 Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen75877803551.87599
 This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley93033.71218866565
  Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell10987.489482691451
 Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings2340.338523481367
 His friends had all deserted him414.16961739616363
 Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions1121245.895341216
 He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God’s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do13351849.059395077
 No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish60312387978.009125
 Anyhow he was all in708.464870536315
  —I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I’m on the rocks32111.44282626482
  —There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher861066.7268750087
 Mr Garrett Deasy233.4086142060457
 You may mention my name333.5655147248018
  —Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man10239.598616959755
 I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh52563.668012564995
 I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers1883.6523560364437
  —I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him2502.7749826941517
  Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street2952911.751275191
 There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob928152112.9296616
 He was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it1872.0577609645065
  Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence18736573.663593426
 However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished2620992893.805548
 But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful13286088.670255609
 Whereas171.6286643281339
 He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing203671516558.27512
 A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation2765.7902904122293
 He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact47837151.431908496
 He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect5010.039702095163
 About biscuits he dimly remembered279.6621805823744
 Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy4023.4808121021274
 However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out599318.9059009026
  —Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him1954.9443851574474
  And so in point of fact they turned out to be8299.861138699642
 Stephen anyhow lent him one of them1243.5029380331193
  —Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman945.8422412490457
 I’ll pay you back one time435.90451068868686
 Who’s that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker1327256.8604753555
 You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there19247.320674257546
 I’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks, man106726.24856233365
 God, you’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the Carl Rosa44369.44926189368
  Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s, bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with O’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe195479936543.74823
 Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable114892.08968971485
 He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when3052525580.5280805
 Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity236797.7119769497
 Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether980432885253031.8
 In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning338619.1535669424
 Pretty thick that was certainly418.82736811688875
  The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite17932635.096622676
 Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:  —He is down on his luck12008081.408952711
 He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman305513.4515337172
  At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:  —Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say37830458260.52757
 Now you mention it his face was familiar to me1543.994094157161
 But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?  —Half a crown, Stephen responded47996781.564258866
 I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere642.663370460682
  —Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does718358.2463771948
 Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds1703.415729133929
 But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of the question15370643.294084257
 And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station8988.107591749562
 Simply fag out there for nothing478.4908333891254
 I don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house?  —To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer466590.65058041946
  —I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday947066.7898293624
 Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved95380.73097242432
  —I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly9036.88071296741
 Why?  —A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one8088293.603689435
 He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you3403.35538554166
 You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did10165743312869.38
  There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that6.221948658232589e+22
 He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals102280.90722470041
 Of course you didn’t notice as much as I did5170.505111416364
 But it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object141999.78411540014
  He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple2.6292436920897613e+21
  —Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out124949.73852252355
  The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less827574435429.2557
 Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet65949.73121207533
  Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties1937671.8831937716

_  Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in62129185763087.086
 A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity13058160.84659335
  —Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description1034075454.9158969
  Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly1732.5579274104123
 The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor5374461.096660431
 Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious:  —A beautiful language4241980349100.514
 I mean for singing purposes275.2547435935855
 Why do you not write your poetry in that language? _Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious and full94244.2089653419

_  Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied:  —To fill the ear of a cow elephant3612646.2675445364
 They were haggling over money288.981747135666
  —Is that so? Mr Bloom asked2464.1916235499793
 Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it963743.4759616384
  The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête-à-tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed27961201.957100373
 After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to26580889.958980605
 For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him1684802.7504800756
  —Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names75729.39094612734
 Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody531.0527946016529
 Shakespeares were as common as Murphies389.73819894743184
 What’s in a name?  —Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred1517716.3065807796
 Of course144.12098290923277
 Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across7607.045788047934
  The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking:  —And what might your name be?  Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered:  —Dedalus5894189482.643844
  The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water204110.35638810415
  —You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length4775.240148593315
  —I’ve heard of him, Stephen said1686.9757139916628
  Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too73403.68696561485
  —He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding12346.066582478014
 All Irish207.46883373050954
  —All too Irish, Stephen rejoined595.8533836220604
  As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark:  —I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder298206336703.192
 The lefthand dead shot234.2105195192068
  Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain216420.54383781675
  —Bottles out there, say771.4818371197714

  He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely5255.836656521923
 Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance16164.164788613412
  —Pom! he then shouted once427.8963970823684
  The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg4215.142713289531
  —Pom! he shouted twice339.82704089608416
  Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily:  _—Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,  Never missed nor he never will120627.56275110693
_  A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley47093.55073749536
  —Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth3133.07053034073
  —Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years416060.86815994605
 He toured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus763.8190455447372
 I seen him do that in Stockholm816.5185740761233

  Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon123734.79929824286
 Across the world for a wife525.640638790736

  The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:  —You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?  The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand1214953213718.2502
  —Thank you, the sailor said1418.8097264291107
  He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded:  —We come up this morning eleven o’clock138936.22476312518

  In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document20609.40920699647
  —You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter366419.83819694223
  —Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on6672.363578161584
 I was in the Red Sea1610.6577131816505

 I seen queer things too, ups and downs885.1595760117563
 I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid3539.198502979437
  He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously:  —Khaan! Like that324152.7905376921

  He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table931283.3631705272
 The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios1423.8336647715446
 Beni, Bolivia208.77215017468262
_  All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier12888731.958365398

  His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more3883.111738012412
  —Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally8566.421038713866

  Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark11074.443960139928
 It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile1737.3907828829404
_ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice25553.150440268255
 Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q6592931862.003412
t42.57803366505022
 somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest24323417242956.027
 Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through149790.61668287724
 But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back11778248.76054277
 The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with683568452492.6102
 Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative175200113397.1468
 Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me your valise and I’ll post you the ticket8720899.361188307
 But who? That was the rub2656.2262393359283
  Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally3662354756503.9453
 A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i91243.71673382237

  It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife131101003881881.23
 After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life131800425.53846955
 There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d’œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar2.170465270185381e+27
 Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired657497.1573965118
 Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact4237186.882477233
 He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen83075.97440926686

  His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to4384.164820543539
  After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket74224.91539937849
  —They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all482483.5669661234
 That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives117918.00553152358
  At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is bliss_ Mr B8360.30193067811
 and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair748739380.9575382
 His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on1729821.0378443315
 Funny, very!  There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause780.5221604989785
 One man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the natives _choza de_, another the seaman’s discharge146609.98113715329
 Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood58189.78498159503
 He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen3562126322.138944
  —Ay, boss, the sailor broke in2480.255408032272

  The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape3516.4582379605295
  —Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired14681.187572023366
  The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no419752.4538804963
  —Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn132661242341.21045
  —What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated1367.5933071862405
 Can you recall the boats?  Our _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering:  —I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships49751429.95034434
 Salt junk all the time568.0745891681238
  Tired seemingly, he ceased384.35996004353655
 On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings3128073511.9574184
 And it left him wondering why424.5058226589857
 And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all8755.932793847367
 Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather2.3978984356100458e+30
  —There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month205455256.0655214
 Them are his trousers I’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife32001.50738236112
 I’m game for that job, shaving and brushup977.8916752359326
 There’s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money136154.87838237
  —What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage6901875195.451488
  —Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny? He’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it84759.43063776827
  The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor4721126.138555245
  —There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts3147.346205144844
 I must get a wash tomorrow or next day946.4150930011555
 It’s them black lads I objects to386.9456875944448
 I hate those buggers420.2266050810183
 Suck your blood dry, they does492.9281204275146
  Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather416577535.0567656
  —Tattoo, the exhibitor explained341.7582127401649
 That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton51811.04371343764
 Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that4748.086289607485
 There he is himself, a Greek1097.5813438829516
  —Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor1321.0981448064624
  That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the5132.234895036828
 Someway in his282.0824970681503
 Squeezing or188.71711866716961
  —See here, he said, showing Antonio8116.664209350297
 There he is cursing the mate431.6491940009986
 And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn77802771.64013885
  And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this time stretched over600033.4470714643
  —Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest15813.874855895943
 He’s gone too227.76973420739716
 Ate by sharks after257.7405863429547
 Ay, ay240.09418024330347
  He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before9040.015152545726
  —Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said718.1890573817042
  —And what’s the number for? loafer number two queried1470.1111637266285
  —Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor865.9429696705052
  —Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number5613361.570727088
 Ate169.19056658640753
 A Greek he was347.9021926070127
  And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end:       —As bad as old Antonio,      For he left me on my ownio236568.37495754467
  The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill9463273.297776025
 Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink799795861267.6576
 His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B15512905961.610466
) and begged the chance of his washing1497.6937315992068
 Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing1292.523828990442
 Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt2266606290.4422855
 Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off623064.0810582531
 Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her6759430458998.572
  —The gunboat, the keeper said705.2375816161396
  —It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least1223575477.9638581
 Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition8125.238042957924
 Still no matter what the cause is from1377.5290628938271
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
  Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:  —In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade217037.06580457967
 Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul4677.091954807965
 She is a bad merchant638.6167116217988
 She buys dear and sells cheap332.98787306143237
  The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start2.1440056074711184e+17
 Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned206681.70241652132
 Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup3243266.5865932065
 I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter32358.09429275181
 Do you?  Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say:  —They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible241994622.4638466
 It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette18531686391.57322
  Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:  —Simple? I shouldn’t think that is the proper word1083853960.6128697
 Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon307813.24726112094
 But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God29598017959013.168
  —O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence15141.511333270304
  On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed272130.3764845669
  —Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief57303.84985425594
 I’m not so sure about that600.5454429451182
 That’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there667852.868722643
 My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn’t tell you110398788315.07686
 Can’t you drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it31036.571402977508
 And take a piece of that bun1903.5277385337247
 It’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised924.6102889457547
 Still no-one can give what he hasn’t got672.9101947864392
 Try a bit287.74822851227765
  —Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further58480.198586238956
  Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work527173.0843034536
 To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders662844220.8788055
 On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying48858565.65210196
 The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of3255679.748282633
 Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where396133.5072214492
 Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved1077396.0113998337
  —Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred30900.33388526263
  —Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual49356633.0599909
 You ought to eat more solid food809.5300866909898
 You would feel a different man637.4343117463718
  —Liquids I can eat, Stephen said852.0829936451318
 But O, oblige me by taking away that knife955.4274164303264
 I can’t look at the point of it5517.714780769126
 It reminds me of Roman history735.2562652713052
  Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it760757.0198052821
 Do you think they are genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots36964.76943647722
 Look at him311.00770819038235
  Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel221733941813.6766
  He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him420313.67599458527
 Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity12639025.009327274
 He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described16538950927.161486
 On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera6582579.455520897
 And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him44227.091141715006
  —Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed21147.801576149657
 Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with2878.3358988450204
 In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods228761462706.66193
 There’s an example again of simple souls511.04526639897597
  However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded4632361279197287.0
 On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap7350804410102365.0
  —Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen8989942.94823488
 It comes from the great heat, climate generally930.0919696951748
 My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is12060.833910314808
 Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, i109296.95607888873
e23.137154072392757
 Gibraltar114.1781031558772
 She has the Spanish type393.5589265332603
 Quite dark, regular brunette, black557.3388025249706
 I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character527.6699042774704
 That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian5161.210305924984
  —The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings38136.07907820488
 _Roberto ruba roba sua_247.8144753222783
  —Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed4501.869458199278
  —Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino9882475.32568566
  —It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once38714.34387216377
 Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there409924307.7593502
 The splendid proportions of hips, bosom452.2002473651461
 You simply don’t knock against those kind of women here728.0069421571276
 An exception here and there668.6806336617898
 Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I’m talking about is the female form57689.6137351309
 Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say531961.1085639431
 Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a thing I simply hate to see110197.12860522242
  Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing71514092.67727898
 Shipahoy of course had his own say to say1198.2044247360054
 He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him13961487384.501038
  So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand35358838.91297882
 That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror27596563.61520846
 Then someone said something about the case of the s3645.9970225851735
 s29.001662258684078
 _Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck156650.93176390106
 No aid was given287.47845403218
 Her master, the _Mona_’s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way95551.16576655192
 She had no water, it appears, in her hold3937.33756710473
  At this stage an incident happened365.65372781008824
 It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat6323.3730697802
  —Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze357105.09959108446
  He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left42225958.87377911
 While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise19581024537374.598
 The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved2700614101975.995
 Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank185992450098.2879
 A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled839.0611224815899
 Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of1.7411253699114212e+16
 And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver161046.41628128404
 He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if, however—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality4341730.718370531
  All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing780807.7274917425
 A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year8934.685603984339
 Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called916.0869871836148
  There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au fait_28109.418431893388
  What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day’s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line11382462421.568403

  That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds258238.05661351807
 Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question1125291486.3556993
 Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation-_cum_-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:       —The biscuits was as hard as brass      And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse73213272.90822187
      O, Johnny Lever!      Johnny Lever, O!  After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided356960.4945225212
 Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein2.2190477079006532e+16
 Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact14712.00399585632
 You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco364575.03353893704
 Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes180598541.58387667
 There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history8135.020397375322
 The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed6622.364769954346
 The Boers were the beginning of the end1691.523254560412
 Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot11815675.722210284
 His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland89207.71216001161
 Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons4874.354743208392

 The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed448.5215680319651
  —Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism55226.02899248007
  To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view14264.488603182157
  —Who’s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated3097.6619808228916
 And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals and generals we’ve got? Tell me that48292.84337204682
  —The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart3898.571700768351
  —That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated1636.7280950632328

 You know Jem Mullins?  While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it179524.74550481455
 Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows71200680.93127324
  From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite9533412673.929033
 It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart38310313771299.13
 Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact2539252.801405789
 And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game1868734448617239.2
 And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (B99096.39255018817
) couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated10250028332.958263
 Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle1986.6302413893293
 Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on1.764812177129603e+29
 In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome1168019.45149731
 He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high5027.215118489991
 Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again1198.8508244984878
 So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £25695.527665198253

 Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender628275.1522935326
  —He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip43618.50093028637
 He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively8952.22763576888
 So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I’m not89054859.28682402
 That was one for him526.8516911450819
 A soft answer turns away wrath382.0753137840382
 He hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw5314.474393291761
 Am I not right?  He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly59295529.96645791
  —_Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other, _secundum carnem_766392.1064173124
  —Of course, Mr B1129.4479502586262

 It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves7976534.299875342

 It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak18737307.639419872
  —Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market5356.83710797791
  Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was overwhelmingly right35494.691870240655
  —You just took the words out of my mouth, he said9928.475119639917

  All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop107389926774.59389
  —They accuse, remarked he audibly362.0256399622434
 He turned away from the others, who probably… and spoke nearer to, so as the others… in case they…  —Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of ruining19647822.24287704
 Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say18888.304537979537
 History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them5634643.020417092

 I’m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum1543626451.6021366

 Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work25091.075163886337
  Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular147869.4415488861
 He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to289498935.0124751
 Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work864310.7379491604
  —Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work1600.139632303225
  The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem19969.65543113308
 observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together7936.1462067909415

 Each is equally important257.7585823631842
  —You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short11481567.896762002
  —I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated12073.873953217262
  —But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me7895.640322642429
  —What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension2666.8209233268017

 Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the latter portion1278.602014782349
 What was it you799.9820240846199
5.498166464669896
5.498166464669896
?  Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:  —We can’t change the country1001610.8745418909
 Let us change the subject460.9162346051313
  At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry89337687.78989543
 The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part3307.78581519598
 Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state33643.520458681014
 Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people312208.6848323965
 With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves287762678942.48724
 For instance there was the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact)26252601334.493477
 And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains10706796544478.732
 Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it8.171853800013778e+25
 Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental94042177431.93503
 Sheer force of natural genius, that573.8159879558796
  For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it257158574.21061695
 Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small3873.4044283557796
 Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind67848.30981064505
 Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz1562362037.9553616

  All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years124714249.70611092
 Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered301668.82340404694
 Something evidently riled them in his death841.696035883481
 Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands38523529414.23886
 Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility472040365.6322743
 Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren’t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between16672310768.575783

 And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat’s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace remark1.9537019546864032e+20
 A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first51741364.347659856
 She put the first nail in his coffin729.6525784661098

 The husband was a captain or an officer1059.5884864075879
  —Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one7984.208354802196
  This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_3637.8022491264383
 As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings8269490791.609526
 First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into9116890628.292328
 Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of4.1806528609280425e+18
 Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s smiles423234133072.183
 The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up13335.461643599883
 Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk? Poser47818.060364583405
 Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly47195.16407972661
 A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass’s kick3.6075294286833914e+25
 Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream30795.49292280334
 And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times175051.6211682044
 Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side348572408.7549002
 North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds9608224223.77057
  —Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun2395603.4496951136
 And, if I don’t greatly mistake she was Spanish too7127.423430648041
  —The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many13127945.813253513
  —Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before42269.53960177127
 Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there8665.140417509305
 So, Spain264.67904205863783
  Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he2232992089.85122
 Her (the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin’s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution22751287.15046845
  —Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated10776.795520455666
 Taken a few years since516.5632038894647
 In or about ninety six488.9996405867282
 Very like her then356.26011333188717
  Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen1073526739.2438381
 As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup1297429376.8373528
 She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the461874.01925308764
 He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum210979579261.31256
 Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest178438.63632837258
 Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop5045.665425743715
 Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word2541.558301326867
  The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to15282385952.29706
 But it was scarcely professional etiquette so670.7264842528165
 Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm268765.4611003469
 And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion975822.5126371705
 Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_1387867.8740236459
 In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out344731.9221017581
 Suppose she was gone when he? I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray9939582437.392654
  The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would38481732.21784623
 Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter449121.6025653988
 And why not? An awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business156779115.86177415
 How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate20825121587.30876
 Then the decree _nisi_ and the King’s proctor tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made absolute325504.21786714566
 But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course394232029.09149194
 He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader’s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O’Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals5.400815354668136e+18
 Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive6366906794.480706
 As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character25086679.550194655
 His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave7.390930564267335e+33
  On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others8.731464685749298e+23
 He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt1.7379527306909286e+18
  It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime3160286.382380552
 In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs5.603450831739961e+17
 The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled16599858.727117194
  —At what o’clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face3610.1836707630273
  —Some time yesterday, Stephen said578.5838864577628
  —Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday2130.01265554805
 Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!  —The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself717140.6624918986
  Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected1003.4712780758839
 At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas917215572.5294154
 For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word3.384784615278849e+28
  Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night20960926.71976453
 The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak40703782256854.69
 On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives60137385.57440356
 Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered258758.3517613508
 His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway45303.37614746044
 For one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable1163326823056.6045
 At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up352297396663.5428
 A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_9.361908445318341e+17
 At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew83874.70513554095
 People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep23116.22957433658
 The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles475.84637378060035
 Your god was a jew350.34908779036545
 Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo10239.79038007218
  —I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over79217.78460536484
 My diggings are quite close in the vicinity1540.025859757693

 I’ll just pay this lot287.2115453662692
  The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to1376116.8485596406
  —Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less975350.5991031772
  All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B’s) busy brain, education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it, and a slice of luck76193639502970.34
 An opening was all was wanted486.3035904589765
 Because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to33258486453.703506
  The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in London somewhere2874405.7891312623
 Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement801.047021105038
 Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to that effect921166.6834511259
 To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why914.0845588443401
  —And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed993.2454390067213
  The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears1030010.5721282174
  —Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried4788.168053759722
  —Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading78360820.12792763
 One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking50163.59637698495
 _The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is She5344.256600039796
_  Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark2322240743300.935
  To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark7.563179461291072e+19
  —Come, he counselled to close the _séance_1065.0521797654726
  Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_5419774.959715177
 Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door225168.57379492672
  —One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment267742.88940629276
 Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés278033.10422262683
 To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation, saying straight off:  —To sweep the floor in the morning35464.194509244764
  So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles138780582.01558927
 The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins47822.57317550761
  —It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment1362249.0130244803
 The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man1824.8002171752341
 Come55.661192586691904
 It’s not far252.97234754001994
 Lean on me265.13498580303
  Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on accordingly6700.338571848297
  —Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that2553450.277524608
  Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc1378.6514309737004
 where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new3757521.307963606
 And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings3939292229.990998
  So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place16473719.21158415
 Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante’s _Huguenots_, Meyerbeer’s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart’s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat12687262933013.545
 He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_7594655.632271781
 He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini’s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather26066869848941.52
 There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore199817149.24900007
 On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn11342021996.623014
 And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel’s air in _Martha, M’appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat1821145303300806.0
 Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B628727069.5427812
 did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull10187534514.244724
  On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull74982966.46356627
 He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence4980292.246482816
  By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:  —Our lives are in peril tonight6472004.728675835
 Beware of the steamroller344.2677774805325
  They thereupon stopped196.81776275878877
 Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts474827941165.16595
 He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world1188809.0165726354
 But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face13004635.64386161
 But it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump774758.1197630616
 Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees35021.89916317449
 Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye118274.8676000199
 These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old1564617.1111678688
  —What’s this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind121015001.62799397
  He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built51548334.95634955
 Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit:       Von der Sirenen Listigkeit      Tun die Poeten dichten1355785.500870238
  These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_715.9431770907582
 Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did166937.93634074889
  A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B5857688783914.401
 A32.03470570996133
 (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you2137310356986.7432
 It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic _conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record—in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have2402807663076321.5
 Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees815107.0239554141
 Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time173657.5508960295
 But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped2132916.6128293416
 Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_1289324333.0530653
 Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows8.475695795760513e+17
 And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone5923170204.001569
 In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all3139334841.0244074
 And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s character, no pun intended1057375829096.1461
  The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds135288511.96237698
 Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired10553.202134134783
 And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car6372.9249184964165
  Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad16564977227.572433
       Und alle Schiffe brücken215.04187747999197
  The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_1499145576.9469745
 As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_1.496227359349307e+17
     [ 17 ]   What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?  Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place608603943408.1003
 Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends66702.79778007063
  Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?  Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen’s collapse2595322051308.7993
  Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?  Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial18431.155241401124
 Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence17128.248356879103
 Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines5745.763725467306
 Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism564.6909645423557
  Were their views on some points divergent?  Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature2456273.247420456
 Bloom assented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († 266 A1984346427.231582
D30.697193884868067
), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree864.6994263287575
 The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman’s hand28268442.581356086
  Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?  The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees70970.33206765816
  Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?  In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and Leonard’s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue1017592.4586440417
 In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross42149.72957410204
 In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines6339.50211019554
 In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown55759.804331484396
 Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom’s) house in Lombard street, west429160.0051449412
  What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?  He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations7795795.6214023335
  As in what ways?  From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived10001531.318953283
  What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?  At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey10142861.561290491
  Was it there?  It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding1095872.1939660818
  Why was he doubly irritated?  Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget120333.85423221525
  What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?  To enter or not to enter59942.16935649952
 To knock or not to knock1290.7689019181494
  Bloom’s decision?  A stratagem340.76825739065515
 Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall647004572531.2434
  Did he fall?  By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV23979745424471.23
  Did he rise uninjured by concussion?  Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle31134483800.116856
  What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?  Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle657605467.9917974
  Did the man reappear elsewhere?  After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor30777.169983293872
 The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges488.0508408123609
 In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle167533.68336743987
  Did Stephen obey his sign?  Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom’s house1410025904.431537
  What did Bloom do?  He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air830700307794004.2
  Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?  Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics’ theatre of university College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father’s house in Cabra1.1284896634164755e+31
  What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?  Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction196423150587.09985
  What did Bloom see on the range?  On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle1549324.7113034301
  What did Bloom do at the range?  He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow26546642.39766363
  Did it flow?  Yes388.234374633196
 From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C6435082870543.385
 E23.137154072392757
, on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound2230563559522087.0
  What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?  Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator’s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90 % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon7.331619561422506e+48
  Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?  To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington’s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller55934463844.64445
  What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom’s offer?  That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language484368485.41118455
  What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?  The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius17825181628.848824
  What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?  Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed1085180.014554706
  Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?  Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation426696.2692569212
  What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?  The phenomenon of ebullition19343.898571859158
 Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether65253622.25789921
  What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?  A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously32870.662238540746
  For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?  To shave himself2957.6126309995016
  What advantages attended shaving by night?  A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman’s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done282004429058309.8
  Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?  Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand253531.01990453535
  What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?  The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery51108888.77227133
  What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?  On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits9221366600.0814
 On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree’s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co’s white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps’s soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch’s choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one, the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy’s cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom’s and Mrs Fleming’s breakfasts, made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak7.582332636442048e+21
 On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences1967.027846321328
  What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?  Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 8 87, 88 629406.424820142372
  What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?  Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_, late pink edition, in the cabman’s shelter, at Butt bridge43755504224.27823
  Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?  In Bernard Kiernan’s licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street: in David Byrne’s licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O’Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon’s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F398252906321.9415

  What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?  The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation1087753.702202199
  His mood?  He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied12716387.452718832
  What satisfied him?  To have sustained no positive loss973.5062798226107
 To have brought a positive gain to others604.4827717696436
 Light to the gentiles518.7479454040196
  How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?  He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps’s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed651092848.7575325
  What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?  Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly)326748824716.47687
  Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?  His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps’s massproduct, the creature cocoa3798399.373129501
  Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?  The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side of his guest’s jacket8816923.167047525
 A gift to his guest of one of the four lady’s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition1130276.528761521
  Who drank more quickly?  Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent’s one, six to two, nine to three101689982.67563602
  What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?  Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life52449412.31686998
  Had he found their solution?  In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points4955334.251940536
  What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?       An ambition to squint      At my verses in print      Makes me hope that for these you’ll find room102517682256.97183
      If you so condescend      Then please place at the end      The name of yours truly, L37780.050504920175

 Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R41951386982477.625

 Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl?  Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist’s non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist’s revelations of white articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from _Everybody’s Book of Jokes_ (1000 pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton2.133474321441414e+26
  What relation existed between their ages?  16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen’s present age Stephen was 614801.957938278372
 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom’s present age Bloom would be 5412449.587188239542
 In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A1.8157457556819103e+18

C23.414818345807948
  What events might nullify these calculations?  The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable16620485.347926918
  How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?  Two559.2667219884411
 The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon’s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen’s mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation270174716.75458896
 The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin’s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen’s father and Stephen’s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older2175621.04642541
  Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?  Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined631270.8095060447
  Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?  He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low’s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_154737956918960.78
  Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?  Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe2046479394.8367126
  What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?  The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers257623549.0991419
  Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?  The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow’s _Physical Strength and How to Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility3883789288109.9595
  Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?  Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles21178180.57472788
  Did either openly allude to their racial difference?  Neither683.9233879285032
  What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom’s thoughts about Stephen’s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen’s thoughts about Bloom’s thoughts about Stephen?  He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not54609097206.59914
  What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?  Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty)259723536.5588068
 Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier)251979.9759302225
  Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?  Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M2537603.441714049

  Did they find their educational careers similar?  Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame’s school and the high school45755.96676207985
 Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university1463458.0881410546
  Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?  Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him221172265.76192936
  What two temperaments did they individually represent?  The scientific711.3155799100001
  What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?  Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump59268015277.44462
  Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?  Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults22721.31214758207
 They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls18347.48259986182
  What also stimulated him in his cogitations?  The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A6649.667160132059
 James, the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George’s street, south, the latter at his 6 1/2d shop and world’s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide69673429421.2152

  What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?  The Queen’s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 1049704028939.56648

  Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?  Coincidence777.1536656090115
  Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?  He preferred himself to see another’s face and listen to another’s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved296395.3244468406
  Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of the Plums_?

  Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?  What to do with our wives2456618.9134909785
  What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?  Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable9544504115290.496
  What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?  In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters14192081.086999316
 She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec290277.10098734975
 She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external1869.7737973795852
 In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid724.2596656165023
 After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall8308.913382789004
 Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture)1266507.1230043867
  What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?  The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction381447.3145820121
 The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment2321.1348063928726
  How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?  Variously1904.7227914749615
 By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other’s ignorant lapse1214809.5889276818
  With what success had he attempted direct instruction?  She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error18011295.172441132
  What system had proved more effective?  Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest524.4043973534584
  Example?  She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat8702078.422222799
  Accepting the analogy implied in his guest’s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?  Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides)321664892.03442454
  What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?  That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain4160842.7673021457
  Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?  Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist)437246.9419290272
  What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?  By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_ (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care)2757922538.1914244
  By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m’baad l’zamatejch_ (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate)117541.37321165175
  How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?  By juxtaposition7032.405447958243
 On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100393656528803015.06
  Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?  Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary142916.02255556892
  What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?  The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S430346745858382.3
 Mary’s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve’s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution1756627.8929321764
  What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreducible consummation?       Kolod balejwaw pnimah      Nefesch, jehudi, homijah4364.244675361187
  Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?  In consequence of defective mnemotechnic13747.278425458597
  How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?  By a periphrastic version of the general text9499.477477806462
  In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?  The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic)1401134.667253381
  Did the guest comply with his host’s request?  Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters11799.307677296847
  What was Stephen’s auditive sensation?  He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past16171.289587529804
  What was Bloom’s visual sensation?  He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future8288.939865221855
  What were Stephen’s and Bloom’s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?  Visually, Stephen’s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair32206.186906217532

  Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?  Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed106793201.1344603

       She took a penknife out of her pocket      And cut off his little head13101.192412870461

  Condense Stephen’s commentary201.46125311789206
  One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined98814.36809624768
 Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny701.2857178378941
 It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting83205.30255271356
 It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting172915.5928471491
  Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?  He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told1827278.5776650892
  Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?  In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy29543.764529291035
  Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?  He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism37989686.548633605
  From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?  From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds982200139.4627882
 From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping12062907.498949718
  Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?  Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression632979902.4930656
  What other infantile memories had he of her?  15 June 18892424.5574171785584
 A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion835.2978886328202
 A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy2727113076.143282
  What endemic characteristics were present?  Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals479185.04868095723
  What memories had he of her adolescence?  She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess3876.717196663768
 On the duke’s lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated)51036.007628632426
 On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated)1962656.8079711748
 On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated)865249.6816175358
  Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?  Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped136483.11794490603
  What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently?  A temporary departure of his cat8358.753685973354
  Why similarly, why differently?  Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian)202337.1001672558
 Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation4273.352234784321
  In other respects were their differences similar?  In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness33886.31138984501
  As?  Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat)22012.567988031038
 Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat)4142956.2866598316
 Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat)366184.1155628367
 Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat)6924651.264959162
 Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar19331.47509278631
  In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?  As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression3314677233250762.0
  In what manners did she reciprocate?  She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware314333.6947458207
 She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires124255.63783826579
 She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part2136291.98933981
  What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?  To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess276815477.7501069
  What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?  For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study24157.233700001154
 For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction868.8643423153713
 For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation796.5233887530669
  Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s daughter?  Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter39032046.35391848
  To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?  If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 19032587432.6906890953
  What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?  A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag)12008737.1660451
  Was the proposal of asylum accepted?  Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined2666.6273389736234
  What exchange of money took place between host and guest?  The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£ 1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former20525481.831283078
  What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?  To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed112060.46812640206
 To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress2021.710652021131
 To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W90970038.33000948
 and E165.40932675962853
 Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit)1095006239092.6075
  What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?  The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler’s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown’s) papa60586734885.956795
 The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J29262821.84275928
 and T114.2794293311277
 Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return94683.54915988527
  Was the clown Bloom’s son?  No513.3975227646489
  Had Bloom’s coin returned?  Never368.63346890634
  Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?  Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity74536.02515333774
  He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?  There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay4164826678455102.0
  Why did he desist from speculation?  Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed1970360.9503343308
  Did Stephen participate in his dejection?  He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void498381.77639286
  Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?  Not verbally1297.6949038115918
 Substantially163.44048197260335
  What comforted his misapprehension?  That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void38600.92002025285
  In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?  Lighted Candle in Stick borne by BLOOM Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by STEPHEN  With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?  The 113th, _modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de populo barbaro_143353271.44068956
  What did each do at the door of egress?  Bloom set the candlestick on the floor75106.26508143471
 Stephen put the hat on his head951.4169354408933
  For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?  For a cat18456.649252376847
  What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?  The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit39502756.51518377
  With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?  Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity5.746260046388812e+20
  Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?  Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached2.026165631085161e+16
  Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?  Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e255968688.40982437
g44.34295650282427
, the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers104972482895123.25
  Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?  Of a different order of difficulty76136825.06680979
 Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity893518136616927.4
  And the problem of possible redemption?  The minor was proved by the major3950.173267654902
  Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?  The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S1.2047768964467594e+16
 Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings1.9794228554609655e+30
  His (Bloom’s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?  That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman39421068.99338035
 That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence105292808330.92094
  Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?  Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet2554031.081059207
  Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?  It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity433180295.2118474
  What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?  Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible1.5778074492978076e+16
  What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s, gaze?  In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street102656653.6261173
  How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?  With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion12139550.692112146
  Both then were silent?  Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces10809.752466516982
  Were they indefinitely inactive?  At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow12035597.154081544
  Similarly?  The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure493498447520.5881
  What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?  To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity1109838.4333722107
  To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails54692519269.9586
  What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?  A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo146559.2771000014
  How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?  By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress289199932.1754901
  How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?  Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles10063683704.375166
  What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?  The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George152767401.6607706
  What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?  By Stephen:       Liliata rutilantium6736.718360752003
 Turma circumdet118.92880866470648
      Iubilantium te virginum106.82451556649058
 Chorus excipiat175.63614142965855
  By Bloom:       Heigho, heigho,      Heigho, heigho1252.4060933464389
  Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?  Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave)5.593377327058892e+19
  Alone, what did Bloom hear?  The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane142977.86995601465
  Alone, what did Bloom feel?  The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn107692.99783172137
  Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?  Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F3203202.0698513784
 Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount)276554.50774014957
  What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?  The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk146934.499910195
  Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?  Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east25932533020.833263
  He remembered the initial paraphenomena?  More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon232144550.64871505
  Did he remain?  With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door6383.206619381392
 With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered63323.21035740104
  What suddenly arrested his ingress?  The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered9212412.867704919
  Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture1596.4527951844332
  A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near 7986.767959590859
 the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of whi83359862.08814375
 to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table13403324.74885136
  One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration2787337.764769056
 The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush828095.3486111688
  What significances attached to these two chairs?  Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence12155.258189939213
  What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?  A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love’s Old Sweet Song_ (words by G2482030809.943117

  With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?  With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the 9622443.964572938
 upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the 17671.72904515817
 words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration3239.81291766334
  His next proceeding?  From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion2.245141946442062e+16
  What followed this operation?  The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense6561.992330148476
  What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?  A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4381108.98249636154

 on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper427770.98528437456
  What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?  In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl11392982.376987763
 Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle320771.17140005203
  What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?  The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man123786.23158392363
  Why solitary (ipsorelative)?       Brothers and sisters had he none1181.2638961052621
      Yet that man’s father was his grandfather’s son682.0872819795504
  Why mutable (aliorelative)?  From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix2340.9476329509043
 From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator701.4224012004736
  What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?  The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite5859947.759372094

  How was the irritation allayed?  He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table1283984.425862671
 He unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences7680579275.263729

  Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?  Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices10584.811506811262
  As?  The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath2108408.3086628006
  How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?  Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared126228.90596257415
  What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?  Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves)253688662856.61978
 Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned158584.90322635765
  Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?  In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences46444367.48063822
  What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?  Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat5966.1078696570785
 Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate1106.0619629712114
 Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper32622.554720887976
  What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?  The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion3079.3057989885424
  What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?  The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip21358.12683809335
  Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity240988.95429269626
  Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector282536.26246900344
 Mendicancy: that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1/4d in the £, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated bailiff’s man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella1854824.055430628
 Destitution: the inmate of Old Man’s House (Royal Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson’s Hospital for reduced but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight119432.2214993705
 Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper819.7702918488558
  With which attendant indignities?  The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing9895219.764044521
  By what could such a situation be precluded?  By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place)38258.873251087185
  Which preferably?  The latter, by the line of least resistance29958.703037889627
  What considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?  Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects811.1937933758234
 The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated561.8425729976926
 The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest621.2906380613097
  What considerations rendered departure not irrational?  The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible137547156.43287957
  What considerations rendered departure desirable?  The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures97488.84437939605
  In Ireland?  The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with submerged petrified city, the Giant’s Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of royal Meath, Brigid’s elm in Kildare, the Queen’s Island shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney101175570.19601282
  Abroad?  Ceylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing Lane, London, E79170.55110916671

, 5 Dame street, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate of Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique birthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues of nude Grecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled international finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where O’Hara of the Camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters of soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea1.192661128103137e+21
  Under what guidance, following what signs?  At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha delta of Ursa Maior431291453.4611342
 On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day61615.63408734124
  What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?  £ 5 reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street, missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy), height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit4902627412.444612
 Above sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery1376.8697220825884
  What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and nonentity?  Assumed by any or known to none4699.119395837591
 Everyman or Noman209.64372053130103
  What tributes his?  Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman2558.0990802353767
 A nymph immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman1841.2500629031983
  Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?  Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events104992663.50766154
 Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall1736.1630618694924
 Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king51503907.97443603
  What would render such return irrational?  An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time24700.795159867543
  What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?  The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire41133685892.22756
  What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied bed?  The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section)9649974799.129017
  What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?  The preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion and premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John): the funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes (Urim and Thummim): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchisedek): the visit to museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along Bedford row, Merchants’ Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the music in the Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a truculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan’s premises (holocaust): a blank period of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and from the cabman’s shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement)4.657286450860853e+30
  What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?  The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the insentient material of a strainveined timber table14050334.090130465
  What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?  Who was M’Intosh?  What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30 years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?  Where was Moses when the candle went out?  What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, charged with collected articles of recently disvested male wearing apparel, silently, successively, enumerate?  A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement: to obtain a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 5 Dame Street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing Lane, London E6158585465735658.0

): to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in the case of Hellenic female divinities: to obtain admission (gratuitous or paid) to the performance of _Leah_ by Mrs Bandmann Palmer at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street40340731.122041926
  What impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?  The face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin’s Barn7847211.693550157
  What recurrent impressions of the same were possible by hypothesis?  Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning3182346929.615596
  What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were perceived by him?  A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies’ hose, a pair of new violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies’ drawers of India mull, cut on generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti’s Turkish cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded curvilinear, a camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened, having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore side in white lettering B399653883815259.25

  What impersonal objects were perceived?  A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady’s black straw hat102868.71526129235
 Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and floor and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate)79110055.12978387
  Bloom’s acts?  He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed407384512521.6073
  How?  With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death33519302972.617928
  What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?  New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed81713215.91169494
  If he had smiled why would he have smiled?  To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity618464500504.1936
  What preceding series?  Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d’Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society’s Horse Show, Maggot O’Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E3.007240681641225e+16
 (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no last term8597.997323094462
  What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed?  Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster)5489192.561250753
  Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?  Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension629019553.917304
  Envy?  Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse1861106.0905188434
  Jealousy?  Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction8233.91029256446
 Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure5536.973283455078
  Abnegation?  In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided1117674142.3549826
  Equanimity?  As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity873743.2250917457
 As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun30923.390995043384
 As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king’s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder1625098138.1474442
 As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease175245.48854084447
 As more than inevitable, irreparable364.34234340624704
  Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?  From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated3597206.5786930714
  What retribution, if any?  Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right5799.343887582944
 Duel by combat, no329.53057002033944
 Divorce, not now340.2618786956954

 Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly360.0023754047661
 If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both2857736.0770907416
  By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?  The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars8.486703320635588e+18

 a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite5.392621376135153e+18

 I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but 8.42811723327827e+16

 Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone73535.33593071322
 For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support13759.777558434274
  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U132322.07039714602
 unless a copyright notice is included381.4222933121221
 Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition4914.056912883433
