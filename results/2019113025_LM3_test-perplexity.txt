  Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind1.1062174384499621e+27
 He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth1.6413607020864879e+63

 She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes1.8635161565288152e+37
 Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin9.874710832997037e+46
