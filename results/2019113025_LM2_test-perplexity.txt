  However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters7.357089941026767e+68
 Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them2.37570783120134e+22

"  "But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs3.1904466411948398e+22
"  "I do not believe Mrs11461.63542088101
"  "No more have I," said Mr52984854.816211544
 Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you1.4087900575819808e+16
"  "Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs9158519573.281145

 But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs3.1474888923976393e+19
 "Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_3.1041255213478857e+37
 Bingley33.49371635676596
"  The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs5.1098680850609946e+17
  "How good it was in you, my dear Mr26421644579.29446
 Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last1202422382615.6182
 I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance5.357129685128704e+17
"  "Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr862824192988197.2
 He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party3.49705368649335e+33
  "If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs1.4040565913971574e+17
 Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library16341296392397.69
 He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father3.801327063340634e+32
  An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs1463250664356165.2
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr6.185446046738755e+39
 Darcy danced only once with Mrs75727834.97950268
  Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr4.733288847134241e+31
  "Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very agreeable7.110212163761204e+40
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party577422335113004.8
 Jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way2.8339894388566587e+21
  "Oh! my dear Mr393.4909611982319
 Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"  "If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners3.1299416113254495e+92
 So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs1.1876595170044552e+58
 What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room1.3713168311894378e+35
  His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs6.1706854836195774e+44
 Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House2.6319861383582495e+28
 He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting1.0631342370512962e+27
 In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage404532987431.3061
 Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty3.7881554294398054e+46
 By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St183885908334030.38
 The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend5.467911811705428e+25
 To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something about Mr1.4137762223677268e+39
 Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point1.738739315600139e+77
 But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs4.447544079282872e+30
"  "His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it6.737280933056657e+30
 I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day1.263709130922633e+26
"  "Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs121080807155979.55
"  The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit6.586678070328858e+28
 Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs3.938846186475845e+16
 If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark1.4860362387332334e+51
 Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal6.356169814299659e+52
 Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend2.9480584859785183e+28
"  "It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas1.322106604880658e+16
 Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I shall keep mine to swell my song1.0606649969483536e+51
 Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room2.6165226886969934e+90
  Mr7.838204499203478
--Every savage can dance10467825533.279373
 James's?"  "Never, sir1387702132.3984768
"  He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,  "My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr1.4259306033267436e+63
  "He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?"  Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away1.0536815236549621e+42
 "I am all astonishment289472.4655203117
 I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced3835083757345.6694
"  Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London2.677197834601763e+42
"  Mrs21.994241784043503
 "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_1658795831940.416
"  "Dining out," said Mrs31136715.94580111
"  "I had much rather go in the coach84031528816.068
 They are wanted in the farm, Mr100317.44001042514
 Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted145449383593949.9
 Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:       "My dearest Lizzy,       "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be      imputed to my getting wet through yesterday1.5194639356479156e+58
 She will be taken good care of5666880354.806579
 She declared her resolution5372500.963549048
  She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise4.525885529319152e+29
 Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance1.1640690810914964e+57
 Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present1.154245012289049e+54
 Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes3.609863712216487e+39
 The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike8.293860048661765e+87
  Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency2.426823320584257e+21
 She really looked almost wild3162344836.031499
 I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning3.033245202950709e+17
  "I am afraid, Mr34984.82975313418
  "If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable4.650057513359152e+31
  With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee2.3796434919613877e+32
 On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book1.0238171972008435e+71
 Mr7.838204499203478
  "I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books1.0918873125353475e+20
 Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite9.961259574873554e+31
 I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished1.7679119172360954e+38
 A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved5.152208339956809e+82
"  "I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women1.7977521719982762e+19
 Bingley urged Mr206861.88908828245
 Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable1.0918771059336912e+17
 They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister8.433322254221185e+57
 Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters1.1109725115052148e+25
  "Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer28363934.20097231
 Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments8408790345.512679
 At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here65324431350621.08
  "You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her5402409236236193.0
  "Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly123653739893.50574
"  "I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character4.4978871400045297e+18
 They have at least that advantage82262605.41447479
"  "The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study4.495219460933076e+23
 The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr84979832625435.72
 They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either4.376109001705563e+18
"  "Aye--that is because you have the right disposition111494990362641.33
 But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all4.496782808337917e+19
 Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every body1.0628564587003219e+35
 I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body better looking2.9414956865253597e+28
 When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away1.1676620598703597e+41
 Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield3.7725924363942036e+18
"  Mrs21.994241784043503
 Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr1.2526098882439212e+34
 The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each1.0154596179820175e+71
  "How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"  He made no answer4.19372862103501e+18
"  "I am afraid you do not like your pen940282235.1889737
  "Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's1.0887958299269928e+57
"  "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At present I have not room to do them justice1.416607451335017e+32
"  "Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable6.621939003585728e+20
"  "Your humility, Mr2156092.8734881524
 At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies5.203852366021432e+27
"  "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either8.290354381743562e+16
 Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection1727227240893814.5
"  "Perhaps I do13945.892437669954
 If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me7.680137781624313e+32
  When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music4.940445404331978e+20
 Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her--  "Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"  She smiled, but made no answer5.715001753292806e+44
"  Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her3.509130719277982e+63
"  "Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"  "Oh! yes1.993999218846386e+16
--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley2.6643840520849614e+20
  "I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard5.6342625606083e+22
 Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening4.002296642419748e+23
   When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared3.6402791326006453e+71
 They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit1.053608436098524e+33
 He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else40527193916589.32
 Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight1.0010150585352705e+20
  When tea was over, Mr29855.75136961849
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep1.965575547784095e+27
 Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page3.386477384322213e+39
 It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day1.0380399306777397e+25
"  Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room11796774454773.469
 In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said,  "Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room5.929514785508809e+46
 Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives2.3089471323302708e+21
 How shall we punish him for such a speech?"  "Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth1.4937772848007808e+28
 "That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance2.532237215186503e+29
 I dearly love a laugh2409709528.6581335
 Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can1.920784201336806e+33
"  "Perhaps that is not possible for any one33302577640.2642
"  "Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed97282699449.73334
 But pride--where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation5.7933035465592066e+26

 Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before4.536526855005942e+44

--But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle3.7807679024489963e+31
 Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married1.901494959916243e+63

 It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour7.23798393583323e+43

 Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness1.0104120718772135e+57
 Bennet could not have chosen better5645045.378745965
 Mr7.838204499203478
 She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her3.292480566044788e+27
 Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman1195954341.6558173
"  "Ah!" cried Mrs6248.229462281937
--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay2.071982299316483e+37
"  Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr1.5444484848527254e+17
 It amazes me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction6.48904115425918e+27
"  Then turning to Mr942227.8157025203
 Mrs9.810835553236354
--Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice1.04382447484671e+48
--"As to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged1.3439626405983142e+70
  Mrs9.810835553236354
  Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr2.196014617363431e+27
 Bennet exceedingly11424.079066873333
 Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr8.528631335941623e+19
 Denny and Mr9868.871521934127
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Collins by Jane's introduction of him725897115.7329414
 She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice3.768870081312823e+62
 Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr2.2389726164758603e+56
 Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows2.475664353748594e+57
 He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before2.831560697562157e+57
     CHAPTER XVI56.24636485292475
 Collins's scruples of leaving Mr143800926.18485638
  When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr1.171024868702578e+18
 The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr9.824780371329968e+28
  Mr7.838204499203478
"  Elizabeth could not but look surprised31634545.84666022
--Here you are in your own family15416792026.25755
"  "I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen1.417323284666396e+40
 A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible1.3434790899646028e+26
 Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it2.7549092350608804e+67
"  "This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced2209175826537278.2
  "But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"  "A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy6.548817992431767e+62
 Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it1.2605223606827504e+38
 It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor1.0002319271100402e+41
 She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished2.2166899268588588e+21
 Bingley! How can Mr1341886.3196690506
"  This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley1.3644366734832507e+17
  "Mr16.23186713533009
 Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully2.8082819072756587e+20
 Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr8.957773791171307e+27
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
     CHAPTER XVII83.2924110012769
   Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr14458688062.616442
 Wickham and herself706.6780643605563
 My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr1.3146149739836524e+16
 Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony3.681329072003088e+34
 Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public1.2585647803301525e+24
 Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday2.2464656279386034e+30
 Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr6.363654674903615e+38
 The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her2.117443543104991e+28
 Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her545021538803.4042
 Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give1.3567595288606507e+55
  She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked1.6108357679383976e+28
 He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her3.1177235528577313e+29
 Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it1.0808773044783519e+23
--But _now_ we may be silent318648574.44236535
 It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible6.636855557264834e+46
"  "I must not decide on my own performance63199939060.98933
 Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, Sir43378561029189.05
 Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves6.374984264955033e+23
 Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable1.283134478494902e+22
 Darcy's steward1501.3215499045657
 Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening3.5345267594540973e+36
 Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr7.041309428587721e+20
 I am perfectly satisfied1145.6582204542497
 I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier1807466215153080.2
"--It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man2.3098938369690032e+17
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr253805471991311.9
 Mr7.838204499203478
 When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr4.766452509381431e+81
--What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr196937018672880.06
 Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her2.79541229834017e+36
 Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another2.105748969393328e+88
 Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman1.465680542690975e+53
 I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family4.933901030969563e+41
 Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable1.7539889603876294e+47
 She was teazed by Mr3168296.363730532
 There was no arguing upon such a project194205760301.95502
 She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr6.504223009981176e+24
  The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs5.028450078094419e+23
 Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves1.0440214465583296e+29
 Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests2.690924587227033e+29
 Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr1.4085746724567534e+40
 Mr7.838204499203478
--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection1.7265286576831306e+16
--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs1215832073445.5994
 Collins must excuse me480699.9016246187
 You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address8.610009774345102e+43
 Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr5.0975462779298925e+17
 To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents3.5811970128596952e+50
 I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time2.4782004926922796e+40
 You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say2.6244808159925617e+18
 I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere1893955893692981.0
 I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible1.4158676665754197e+25
 Bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so1.1036571153033098e+42
 She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it3.2227554662362984e+27
"  "Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr42766529112.1859
"  "Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs1462944450817.4734
 In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived1975346591684472.8
 Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_4.3218947424269915e+26
 She shall hear my opinion24053286.880372647
"  "An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth6625786549376.856
 Though her manner varied however, her determination never did2.410564247477559e+16
 "Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves1.9485318284624816e+48
 People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking8.247789203900198e+25
"  Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation1.174946780545316e+35
 Collins and me have a little conversation together8219520579.299434
"  Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr1.4028765953069172e+43
 In a doleful voice Mrs196246383.5842907
 You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr2.0226354565695906e+45
 My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own8.574362053506022e+32
 Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother2.79123219985292e+39
  The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs281754071337.8241
 When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,  "This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal2.3689419407173706e+40
  "It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country3.422504697191523e+24
"  "Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter7.636712908203251e+20
 Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I despair4.90549832784982e+42
 I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable2.937911123736892e+38
 My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart7.5962544865282e+76
 With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"  "What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"--said Jane as she finished it1.4364966259683267e+67
 "Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"  "Yes, there can; for mine is totally different4.9003991692949e+107
 Could she have seen half as much love in Mr768880547251.6218
 But the case is this2355717.2656539227
 We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way2.4060089514265412e+84
--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine2.785445109758291e+21
" Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time6.724170562919791e+31
  In as short a time as Mr9452893727.848663
 Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair5.821448381737888e+40
 The least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person1.8191702081235237e+35
  As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs6.829273521751162e+38
"  "Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire4.837890316374281e+56
 She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion7.778799115593632e+70
 Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"  But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness5.573149067918327e+76
 Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted1.6815416109193473e+25
 Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day1.7085418689857852e+64
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs1.0924424914676577e+28
 Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted9.512890703104839e+37
 Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr4.94064417924529e+24
 Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"  "I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr9.355518309616301e+26
 I284.4159064920414
 Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it91457480381.22147
  Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation1.8215615307285252e+22
 That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations3.4297586303283718e+90
 Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself4.501080240682642e+50
 Thank God! I have not _that_ pain6838078037749.777
 A little time therefore3220506.8274077475
"  "My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good42842405102118.53
 They will ruin your happiness47453397.0394824
 Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin1.1818592078619074e+57
"  "To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart7.310831592474642e+61
 Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking6.423646543488979e+52
 But enough of this561731.4232027422
 I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk8.250041223557241e+41
"  "And do you impute it to either of those?"  "Yes; to the last9.755332912070285e+17
 Stop me whilst you can265412442425.78354
"  "Yes, in conjunction with his friend320338475.8020052
 Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it7.797434535876045e+33
"  "Your first position is false34647725719.78859
 Do not distress me by the idea467380391.0632324
 I am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters9.613424054615961e+34
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 I congratulate her84503.58643580473
 It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions2.5107832552044593e+20
 Darcy was condemned as the worst of men118214565738.28526
 Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday26488462726721.387
 Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education8.181111398520135e+26
 The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable3.002292465466333e+37
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions2.919440765532024e+27
 Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of4970467097018561.0
 Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it3.614684992120696e+18
  "I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr72541637445199.53
 He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him5.694429483066532e+17
 The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever9.033545825260616e+29
 The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister4453188404565.263
 They are all for what they can get21064039815.026398
 "I am sorry it went off453566.34211688704
 But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr3.0284543364162613e+19
 He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her4.2809559239707224e+16
 But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything2.1728088415753058e+45
 We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her5.590759607607949e+58
 Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr3.328777231062645e+29
 Bingley never stirs without him2114311357.4311275
 I hope they will not meet at all527931318.1496796
  Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him1.6314611933591363e+62
 When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr6.248024119355194e+25
 They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring3.5672550180567e+58
     CHAPTER III55.98749846980634
 Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:  "You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly5.8592647283646e+78
 Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent2.4299220985130444e+29
 At present I am not in love with Mr7932440.981610173
--Oh! _that_ abominable Mr582876688.7539802
 Will you come and see me?"  "We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire2.3331805419951567e+19
 Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford3784057388.5182624
  "My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party1.4152145785135411e+26
 Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them3103783172771255.5
  Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is5.118393082107746e+21
 I enquired after their brother, of course8089454256.005013
 I wish I could see her32591.8707883211
"  Elizabeth shook her head over this letter2741515791.5866504
 The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt1.9887222392150141e+18
 I do not at      all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but      if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should      be deceived again3.9313546802550816e+38
 I need not explain myself farther; and      though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she      feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so      deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may      feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable2.5618428579792237e+77
 I cannot but wonder,      however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at      all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago1.3973114451504735e+40
 Let me hear      from you very soon22603596.14218168
 I am      sure you will be very comfortable there191516919.18952423
"  This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least1.4016873867873635e+34
 Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain7.13626095009787e+25
 My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance1.41093482386201e+47
   With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away2.86189177071181e+52
 There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake1.4155043512747402e+46
 The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay2.607028302475272e+32
  Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt151150130562.5784
"  "No--why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"  "But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event2.0417242651690604e+79
 Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him4.061787954158151e+35
 Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes4468526.071987293
 Adieu to disappointment and spleen6413830241.283202
 Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party2.1951600868998223e+39
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground1.5964100175016648e+16
  From his garden, Mr570383.9408131778
 It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr166148233269182.94
 I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several7.876988392907583e+17
"  Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate1.5984615418260693e+55
  "And is this all?" cried Elizabeth57039016.055146046
 The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough1.472903634451289e+73
 But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"  "I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire8.155081271353611e+98
--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr7.846372160424536e+33
  When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm3.3814718466848925e+30
 Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater5.925305663493306e+46
--It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family13486997357237.305
"  "Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you4263335615532998.5
 The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's3.035069985936637e+24
"  "What, none of you?"  "Not one197411305927.75632
"  "My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London2.420984815689099e+16
"  Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case19947409956175.324
 It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way1.842030790721456e+20
 I am always glad to get a young person well placed out1.045282173051265e+17
 Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her1.8524748771568095e+48
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure8.119888992106154e+32
' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"  "Yes, Ma'am, all1.5772252025432873e+18
 And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind5.37694478191211e+31
 Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr1016862.73244585
 Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light7.264213909761874e+34
 He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names7.845347394828183e+17
 Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered30386803300.41133
  From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr9.579732540227752e+18
  Very few days passed in which Mr110335612.18452823
 Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important1.249265047650487e+39
 There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr2.6902526626599036e+16
"  Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room8.614035364230426e+40
 Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure3.8265763624411365e+20
 Darcy they had only seen at church17830452169.179726
"  "We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply1.244045273510347e+17
 And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply8.589186555847512e+17
  "I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal2.5783449101167466e+37
"  "So much the better166.9144164902746
 Jenkinson's room4757919.11822341
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer1.1848672307053157e+17
 Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,  "You mean to frighten me, Mr7.57407165944262e+36
"  "I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own1.2122723127724145e+60
  "Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam5.710061255300492e+16
"  "You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful9.904006005109136e+16
 But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practising1.195608841606776e+23
     CHAPTER IX83.2924110012769
 As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr3.3080132969896675e+58
 Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr9076804234.304382
 Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle1.4977610760693174e+36
 Collins first came to Hunsford922960.7605629098
 Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance9140046174949.75
 "I should never have said Mrs108225.65443420922
 Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far2.8957700852875563e+19
 But that is not the case _here_4114220043.697647
 Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day2.3831963624742224e+77
  She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs6.295838616714741e+26
  In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam1.4268910599431091e+20
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
"  "I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage6.0520989299886235e+35
 Are you going much farther?"  "No, I should have turned in a moment3.647348878539961e+17
 But I am at his disposal164932.48860503148
 Darcy19.074490057073533
 It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor3.7405229754822506e+29
 I speak feelingly579509.0898574959
 But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money2.709307580156779e+18
"  He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped9044192735549262.0
 I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind1.1906222215862934e+19
 She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs2918607257162.974
 Hurst and Miss Bingley223.0252984642505
 I think I have heard you say that you know them103567935.53141129
 Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him397222695873635.25
"  "Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care2.9645040413989487e+34
 Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"  "I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady6.861164303969553e+20
 After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful1.5742489809411566e+18
 It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case85981072523.6883
 There could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr4.027423049800047e+19
 Darcy could have such boundless influence7552713722.347587
  "To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection7.746269360587637e+19
 He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security9.226294643724228e+23
 I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one204538817392.83954
 The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation6.382356850149305e+36
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful137107985948.38257
 He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity1377472994823049.0
 You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert5.091232513485668e+30
 I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been1.8576857956572432e+23
"  And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house7.446110167165823e+31
 But the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name1.743901351545119e+29
--The envelope itself was likewise full4430352457461.454
      You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I      demand it of your justice5.988988028652341e+46
 Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in      defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,      ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr1.0321554682552605e+46
--I had often seen him in love before1499721318.4380605
 He spoke of it as a certain event,      of which the time alone could be undecided1.0902662552977324e+22
--The situation of your mother's      family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that      total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed      by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by      your father1.5283002982370864e+55
--But, however this remonstrance might have      staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it      would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been      seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your      sister's indifference3.826839339572214e+63
 He had before believed her to return his      affection with sincere, if not with equal regard4.055778359361603e+21
 To persuade him against      returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,      was scarcely the work of a moment9.112564382524892e+26
 Wickham, I can only      refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my      family5.556862824073843e+22
 Darcy could not have24239.58752160563
 There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds361369470.7215032
 His own      father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these      events, Mr1.1595626754422855e+25
 Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally      resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it      unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary      advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be      benefited6.811426952762366e+60
 In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his      studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all      restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation1.1448484779329643e+48
 Having said thus much, I feel no      doubt of your secrecy3.411279228646781e+16
 She was then but      fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her      imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to      herself7.981627415011148e+38
 Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my      sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot      help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a      strong inducement4.742340488740161e+43
 But I was not then      master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed3.2779112043180385e+21
 She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes3.610444538392705e+46
 It was all pride and insolence333456338.0974832
 On both sides it was only assertion4243736971.3354387
 After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read3.400334043541145e+21
 His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn1.3917829959381661e+53
 Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr40798276.22291885
  When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe1.2615481100648564e+37
  The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt3597560339767.3154
  Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party2530875215735.146
 His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases17912851836.147636
 I expected you to stay two months65745284.075269304

--Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father2734364758895664.5
 You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves3.944230390197609e+24
 It is highly improper17865952.115244873
 You must contrive to send somebody1589134093.8361163
 Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner5.438621709927724e+19
 Where shall you change horses?--Oh! Bromley, of course3.8314792722535654e+17
 Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections2.8792939450474153e+63
 They were hopeless of remedy234362700.78346714
 Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil9.795620580960721e+55
 While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever4.972679629153955e+35
 How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!  When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful1.1403351879154933e+113
  Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first6.296046420554414e+20
   On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr64537816.09398948
 She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged6.454510875470878e+34
 Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent2.3843822074442173e+42
 My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking2.06069468052376e+16
 There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us1.8230955277234713e+19
 We seem to have been designed for each other71235607.71588716
 Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr6.763400326952645e+45
 But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation8.642649182226112e+21
  It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr3.213372643812099e+27
"  "Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction693239334706.6616
  "They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all3.04889231347209e+51
 Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"  "Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once5.248999255495036e+52
"  "Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to table5702080569792.763
 "What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like1.1925796649543251e+28
"  Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay1.0155784240335973e+18
 But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone1512659556349558.8
 There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay2.444174248194124e+25
"  "She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him155656364122281.5
  "I am sure there is not on _his_1052692651.3706845
 I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her1.2111409264276236e+19
 She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think8.931867464822762e+44
 In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account1.1990897842224322e+28
 Darcy and herself118.86235509921774
  Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings1.8260931739646136e+47
"  She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham4.970906164220048e+22
 "You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing6220948579559957.0
 Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered902764625217812.1
"  "There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men2.78455741390114e+20
"  "I never thought Mr94399.46285940117
 It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind4.847908387963958e+27
 I was uncomfortable enough64850.06051384788
 Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved5246639143066903.0
 To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever2.59863048085684e+16
 Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery5.3438512558517636e+48
 "And then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself1.7275371073561623e+41
"  "Oh, well! it is just as he chooses9730938833443.008
 _They_ will take care not to outrun their income75178157959813.98
 _They_ will never be distressed for money1206862306659.7344
 But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves158566986467851.16
 Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better4.847986084619046e+22
 _I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me5.236922905307171e+16
   The first week of their return was soon gone1546339707431.113
 The second began199029.8199759236
  "I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away4.076850397642875e+22
"  "A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever23013569973653.586
  The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs7085719452249121.0
 Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home1.6917488942623666e+30
"  "Already arisen!" repeated Mr1025226331.0174598
 Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret6.087208343942771e+27
 Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly4.667615002673193e+30
 Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,  "Do not make yourself uneasy, my love2.8324550524133196e+26
 Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance2.9531747470456704e+18
 She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once7.235861616967169e+84
  He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him1.6898184363979554e+52
"  "Yes, very different13348.440151457024
 "In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was2328559218550655.5
 Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right5.758162012115272e+30
 His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by9.359767010831943e+44
 Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy9.427809208809175e+25
 He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments5.641436490537934e+26
 It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment2.536951768305434e+65
"  The period of expectation was now doubled638892933786.5558
 Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival1.7604371172802308e+16
  The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement1.8259142404011435e+23
 are sufficiently known14540049.840638936
 Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated2.251345084174217e+66
  "My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt2.2280573208098246e+24
 Wickham passed all his youth there, you know4286778439232.163
 They have some of the finest woods in the country4039366078992.051
 A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme9.330454985933145e+76
     [Illustration: MATLOCK]     PRIDE AND PREJUDICE:  A Novel53157958.59432108
        London: Printed for T140.43205024373748
   Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter6.364675728378261e+42
 Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned9.967931636890893e+16
 She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste2.0406439253056565e+34
 The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object2.1104353062101442e+36
 It was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago3829566115353381.5
 Darcy?"  Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little36477438648.7934
"  "I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this6.452932159245088e+35
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Gardiner28.97482899810657
  "Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long9.719089840543656e+28
  "Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"  "Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months2.2044028361782566e+44
 Darcy!" thought she94554.25976825766
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves3.5062453211334794e+18
"  "That is not very likely; our authority was too good716035701692506.0
  "He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows4.870896977130585e+16
 Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her3.946645044276945e+19
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs3674210786.8354983
  She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome5.907952036713781e+30
 They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family3.246197207027348e+49
 And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting4.815361515104322e+79
 With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round7.434156347625183e+17
 It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts1.8455322519768191e+56
 Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr1.617309631888281e+36
 Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance3230915141935.1377
 Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph22310881900.485012
"  After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration7.522735536049152e+61
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together1467997243473.814
 After a short silence, the lady first spoke6422113979.073645
 Bingley and his sisters2355.0505910888273
 She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her2.4230855434860548e+57
  They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought3.1079260821317796e+16
 Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind704474039151.4025
  He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn5.079517458096158e+26
 "He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle1.5468535765479734e+17
 Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else1.149190736379846e+62
 Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance2.5434328350515466e+55
   Elizabeth had settled it that Mr196570.20683023386
 But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came1.454643600973033e+27
  Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place6.907897380997056e+17
 With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself7.1884179800546244e+22
 They had long wished to see him20362258.13387279
 Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased1.2206421649196378e+19
 Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance5.669889502201681e+47
 But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane5.881236957686457e+30
 No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard603870354523718.6
 Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight7.74040172644685e+27
 He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister1.5004434163717913e+92
 Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London8781135884505.48
  The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs1.3383848872842075e+64
 Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement4.6045362385819944e+16
  Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more6.293674974399775e+57
 Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully1.8055344502352022e+53
  Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while Mr5.0159641550707425e+20
 Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer4.763934352130223e+47
 They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs8.197726367983986e+31
 Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs9750085.829906872
 How thankful am I,      that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must      forget it ourselves1.564948166026179e+33
 F26.884187799000365
 who instantly taking the alarm, set off      from B1.7841636374481828e+16
 I know not what to think688.4480641341996
 After making      every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F3.554136683762326e+17
 My father and mother believe the worst,      but I cannot think so ill of him4513291349340.863
 I grieve to      find, however, that Colonel F622500213949.479
 Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed      their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot      wonder4.427209937830904e+28
 Darcy appeared770.2457060121433
 Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you1.1989361300952577e+59
 Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose1.6187514643910775e+21
 Wickham34.031571574818216
 They are gone off together from Brighton200361782.55103445
 _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest298970013177.8588
 But it is all, all too late now433850982720.6407
 Her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace1.994773762729331e+36
 The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl1.0168360026535332e+19
 It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it8.933181692690526e+21
 Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland7061490454300.018
"  "But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"  "Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all1.1603339719792384e+42
  When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give1.5261341696861844e+36
 The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage8.265381059271267e+75
  "If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her3.673469669388537e+38
 Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia3434955004708.9634
 And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married9.863528494551064e+39
"  "Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm3.160965579307266e+33
 I am so grieved for him847671.1110860762
 His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost246232859625.4717
 Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step5.130179220842624e+39
"  "Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it6.12580502250997e+17
"  "Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you11210276416026.88
 She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us7.164236408100759e+52
 Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied7.316751014482109e+16
   The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr1786591566.6407437
 Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel1.4615112192359925e+38
 Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces8.082592156970089e+31
 Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street1.8704760192552225e+45
 If there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence1.0293926367983196e+37
 Collins and      myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable      family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest      kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove3.376094638025228e+49
      And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to      suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness      of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree      of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of      yourself and Mrs3.1295911714899948e+62
 And this consideration leads me moreover to      reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last      November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in      all your sorrow and disgrace2.481668167791858e+52
       "I am, dear Sir, &c9854809.15557224
 His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them1.5995122348581017e+36
 And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount1.6937408340862277e+62
 Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton3.1919737269668276e+20
  "What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!" she cried1847316495062317.0
 He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it2.0085283800182334e+37
  "This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away9.508951669716416e+88
 No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village3.5982333572513085e+24
  "Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy1669462280.6830955

 Send back your answer as soon as you can,      and be careful to write explicitly7.421026456204914e+22
 I shall write again as soon as any      thing more is determined on175253247621471.5
       "EDW164534.43613748054
"  "Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished87336168215.82693
"  Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote1.0266647925373706e+21
  "Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately11521131633001.357
"  "That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before59800005287817.95
 He has children of his own, and may have more1908282868742.1123
 The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited967527007643.3071
 He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied,  "Just as you please5.1370334726879347e+20
 As soon as Jane had read Mr12416299.446549146
 To know that her daughter would be married was enough67475982345.68766
"  "Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents2.764322786542082e+68
  "I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips4.084837656860169e+26
 This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving8.815620296258331e+23
  That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible1.9234283170753606e+45
 But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain1.4311624807130502e+73
  It was a fortnight since Mrs5856787.740311129
 There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much3.9575794055962296e+45
 Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them2.9863104309855626e+35
  She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her3.4204827011505846e+27
 To Mr82.70839375133129
 Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again4.997618539881246e+43
 Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia3434201429.93157
       "It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon      as his marriage was fixed on2.9338510563116273e+22
 Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much6.533781222180408e+29

     CHAPTER IX83.2924110012769
  They came17827.52082263534
 The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them1259486574816.7368
  Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room2.1184255215469396e+18
  Their reception from Mr36351.906538741154
 Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked1684904397026.273
 Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless7.443108854710481e+25
 Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world1.328781279768811e+34
"  Her father lifted up his eyes1182347577.515677
 Wickham," by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to Mrs3.997226789983937e+29
 They must all go to Brighton4240043.621704528
"  Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them1151972797953821.8
 Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home1.397514539220514e+42
  Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him2.7705914526579206e+22
 He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country4.279330288033637e+34
 However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham3.9798604055994874e+27
 To be sure London was rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open3.2986718732449523e+21
 Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr2.025130880197184e+29
 And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it4.3195173440629053e+18
 Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement12992407982.138592
 I must confess myself      surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_1.0950327203139292e+18
 It was all      over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked      as _your's_ seems to have been9.77218839745183e+32
 But      it was two or three days before he could get from her what he      wanted1.7917058625847056e+17
 Darcy's next step was      to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in      Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home3.813822193965213e+29
 But at last your uncle was forced      to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,      was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,      which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your      letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an      explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give      the praise where it was due3.0973274208103585e+95
 The reason why all this was to be done by him      alone, was such as I have given above3.877962690851719e+19
 I shall never be quite happy till I      have been all round the park132696870306331.44
 A low phaeton, with a nice little      pair of ponies, would be the very thing6.540253574237608e+23
 She was ashamed to think how much28914073.792965423
"  "True85.8508813555486
 I wonder what he can be doing there25543311935.14542
"  "How should you have liked making sermons?"  "Exceedingly well1.5485647402814031e+18
"  "I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly1.4695065539112986e+61
"  "You did! and it was not wholly without foundation251449505065.4647
 You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it4.040011032627798e+16
 Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know1322112854.419433
 In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind16114393166370.809
"  She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house3.3488551693531275e+30
     CHAPTER XI56.24636485292475
 Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth6.354216560180237e+39
"  But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation1.8154076163297688e+54
 He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again6.554388097366851e+16
 And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"  "You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs1.4383307716363842e+22
 But don't imagine it was from any silly cause5336569819997393.0
 I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him9.618478566566426e+21
 Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks5.744040549779579e+19
 Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it6.802777019126733e+71
 They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them2.620875301726969e+17
"  Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr1.636207470403812e+41
"  "Good gracious! Mr3686.537994591025
 She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter1.4407809024798896e+43
  The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken2.2204077850783307e+63
 But she would not be secure513941.17832507234
 On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance4.933045275815661e+47
  Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied1.4198233425547775e+53
  He readily agreed to it2785355.85691808
 to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing8.4549752323129e+28
 It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it5.172792925853526e+25
 Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell48825401.26805395
 His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars1.7218594901369568e+24
"  "My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now3.9798973229087704e+16
"         *       *       *       *       *  They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs1.455110694650889e+16
 Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself8.814788551427501e+24
 On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided5.3502876208318144e+29
 He placed himself by her46100554.047267824
 He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr5.650063144572505e+36
 Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour1.976879263489302e+22
 She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage1.0955011730026789e+24
 Annesley is with her758274.1464170046
 They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself2.0436266027450837e+44
  Mrs9.810835553236354
  "Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you1.679512877073911e+35
 The venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch5.393686791000445e+29
 I hope we may often meet again1098458555.2847235
  "Lizzy, you must not do so1124501.061768493
 You must not suspect me904145.2252671021

 &c79.62702059944802
 Make haste, make haste573409.0008851126
 In a few minutes, Mrs23474.187294675085
"  Elizabeth was forced to go17598.156668263222
 "Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room1.2423894640393654e+18
  Mrs9.810835553236354
  After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference57792626762757.836
 Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs28560452791949.324
 Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter1.1900427762385006e+21
 Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes4.420949398760976e+47
 Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane3424700889887.4575
  "I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried4844805265209.868
 "I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself5.022752366879611e+25
 Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"  She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty6.463865604778161e+63
 She will be down in a moment I dare say375257181.50910187
"  He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister5.055628612778454e+26
  "You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled4.918363153322978e+22
 Jane was beyond competition her favourite child8708382075.017744
  Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur1.1827125996079689e+61
"  "That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever heard you utter1.10971664403982e+20
 Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard5.81470805801378e+27
"  "Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"  "He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty6.242477642252368e+58
  Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him5.350719064190059e+43
  "I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried Jane6.6955528140993044e+19
 "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but such another man for you!"  "If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you1.4890916625786843e+73
 Mrs9.810835553236354
"  "Yes, very well2250.0237825669215
"  Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling1.3885218551409475e+32
 But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled448601664535635.75
"  Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs2.1777441665669576e+25
 Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come1.5130722179200336e+20
 My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it1.5324674279094335e+36
 Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you2.611079711181775e+56
 What could your ladyship propose by it?"  "At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted2.944639328484458e+28
"  "Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth, coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence1.0762895120371307e+39
 Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied12953738025.8232
 You may have drawn him in435651370.2124089
"  "Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this1.5768108808218335e+22
"  "But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit1.6727964133090855e+27
 If Mr498.8095875754425
 Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all5.394642252401535e+34
 Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be1.8935568427814132e+16
 You _are_ a gentleman's daughter21545295.42938185
"  "Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_1.4501992323096914e+25
"  "Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"  Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation,  "I am not2.0219980321164728e+54
"  "And I certainly _never_ shall give it6762587123.031368
 Your ladyship wants Mr3102571.7924126047
 Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make _their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged1.8330491441507924e+102
 I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement2.4984621217163096e+19
 I must beg to return to the house1669162.2356913004
 You refuse, then, to oblige me1157140127.0385766
"  "And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well4.541109860354508e+20
 You deserve no such attention14766732.347437454
"  "She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well1.0490710595812847e+40
 I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"  Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible1.3692315437327761e+38
 Lady Catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr1.6610197946358956e+38
 Darcy19.074490057073533
 And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible, at some future time8.367264614705222e+67
  "If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand it9.230783325086653e+32
 I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy2.2142003600692736e+17
"  She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held1.047114928533791e+40
 This letter is from Mr1283946.5110768895
 Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land1.2569572181734901e+66
 Pray read on43651.74604101177
 But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it4604335788.844315
 For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"  "Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted2.4258367181170128e+39
 And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"  To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it6.498349825115927e+65
 Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr3.701983315217155e+16
 Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out1.4374272075587932e+47

 Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together1.2985788909208018e+25
"  "I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness5.43695307736008e+42
"  "If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone1.4446517386241434e+17
 But your _family_ owe me nothing4304285190705.2256
"  "We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said Elizabeth1.0577150634312398e+22
 The adieu is charity itself26089348478.463627
 I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong1.506493919289539e+23
"  "My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to1.7265987600244448e+68
"  He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend2.1305092363775433e+100
  "I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth6476857502018.078
 When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen488170509279.9772
"  "That is to say, you had given your permission1150875707767.1929
 I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent2.3338324178439278e+23
 I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection4.974895720895963e+31
 Bingley is most unaffectedly modest5315364279.68465
 I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him1.233020896381019e+34
 He has heartily forgiven me now4586861501.279758
     CHAPTER XVII83.2924110012769
 "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be3276379.478298493
 Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth153291423807455.5
  "Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried Jane1.7639776867181027e+22
"  "What do you mean?"  "Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley5.8499074061023e+18
 I always had a value for him14764546.5619263
 But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me6.183083474405454e+16
"  Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy1091681685951.31
         *       *       *       *       *  "Good gracious!" cried Mrs3958942.702953963
"  "It may do very well for the others," replied Mr291580018972.8871
 As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs30923364400.2835
 Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening55357933156.52414
 Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr377503105.2399306
 In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library2.4563550380570096e+40
 "Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"  How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr1.816949503387647e+105
 He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane1.3918223043622734e+25
"  "I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him2.488716610638533e+17
 Indeed he has no improper pride28752341364.521065
 I know your disposition, Lizzy9123454.47997489
 I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy1.150876523911023e+20
"  He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr1.4025148172648086e+17
  "My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence2.2050213580500878e+33
 Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow2179047922474978.0
 "Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane's4.804430529509492e+25
"     CHAPTER XVIII84.71383942266296
 Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her2481584372042.5723
 It is too long ago136145.91125475703
"  "My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not4.5269891754449906e+52
"  "You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner313551090443005.5
 _Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject? This will never do2.7226531814975374e+49
 I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's3.724942348927929e+16
 But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected1.032280660605173e+16
 Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr1.8471294246160028e+23
"  Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere1.4501444623509691e+23
 She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard6.453537371603741e+25
 Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved1.9100227984913052e+40
 Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge3.8807590676551655e+29
 He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St6.3939907350091214e+44
 James's, with very decent composure4864301598.841571
     CHAPTER XIX56.24636485292475
 He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected4.965473158390846e+16
  Mr7.838204499203478
 In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great8.01278339200845e+19
 Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going2.748419161792212e+34
  Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth4.7732098515295905e+78
