     CHAPTER I46.42458135002346
   It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife1527606.3431853142
  "My dear Mr79.81860119910105
 Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"  Mr500269.07421514264
 Bennet replied that he had not3248.004916254777
  "But it is," returned she; "for Mrs11776.354051851915
 Long has just been here, and she told me all about it13375.120235867458
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Bennet made no answer97.01242272256815
  "Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently138228.99955720137
  "_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it423139.0248593124
"  This was invitation enough137.38329323573439
  "Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs14178.855463604168
 Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr2195046597.2891684
 Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week35928516.498478845
"  "What is his name?"  "Bingley7194.887078064077
"  "Is he married or single?"  "Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year99455629.10815032
 What a fine thing for our girls!"  "How so? how can it affect them?"  "My dear Mr1615676.816190319
"  "Is that his design in settling here?"  "Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes2719177158467.276
"  "I see no occasion for that779.6652069656557
 You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr12070496.852746936
 Bingley might like you the best of the party1119.136810449613
"  "My dear, you flatter me646.1874220976525
 I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now1590629.9150475883
 When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty18810.025397232534
"  "But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr8449.324799135471
"  "It is more than I engage for, I assure you5864.51231166652
"  "But consider your daughters165.5191222632386
 Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them15881.39687464231
 Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers117546.68206846062
 Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not1763656.1084601947
"  "You are over scrupulous surely197.64059561154022
 I dare say Mr161.14427622900536
 Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy4155683024.3394656
"  "I desire you will do no such thing679.9507232504101
 Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia11282136.7710428
 But you are always giving _her_ the preference2928.7273148790578
"  "Mr27.541780616983342
 Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me69867.01831854654
 You have no compassion on my poor nerves802.687379701195
"  "You mistake me, my dear763.7556652222131
 I have a high respect for your nerves422.4540689844551
 I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least1565.3173770117435
"  "Ah! you do not know what I suffer8936.015308819417
"  "But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood1785832.0214395053
"  "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them256318.69501990316
"  "Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all469859.66237949353
 Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character1828429.5385083477
 She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper3261.531144130187
 When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous544.0500665134971
 The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news7853.41083645597
   Mr7.838204499203478
 Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr864.3698987190985
 Bingley33.49371635676596
 He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it444077676.5492616
 It was then disclosed in the following manner397.2265876260201
 Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,  "I hope Mr127661.4817453493
 Bingley will like it Lizzy157.9234997681799
"  "We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr4447.265453525073
 Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit79842.76859356549
 Long has promised to introduce him363.57528737404596
 Long will do any such thing233.61576682080684
 She has two nieces of her own900.6312752632359
 She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her76855.6717134519
"  Mrs21.994241784043503
 Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters28156.53692742855
  "Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves13332.409452298418
 You tear them to pieces166.80409662833867
"  "Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill41612.10006078962
"  "I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully15988.579184278364
  "When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"  "To-morrow fortnight50693.62668962444
 Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself70235025.77907719
"  "Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr557199.2110150541
"  "Impossible, Mr113.90742079053584
 Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?"  "I honour your circumspection10638605.191663658
 A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little289.0420065754964
 One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight3824.9500706790163
 Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself22554764.85479687
"  The girls stared at their father337.18755535684653
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!"  "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he541552.3187564812
 What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts625885.7790553304
"  Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how5633.0334281379855
  "While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr29560.032529131517
"  "I am sick of Mr276.69547847467993
 Bingley," cried his wife1140.5669038834228
  "I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him613128034.649548
 It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now91098.98696133631
 Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while7241267.899111904
 Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now211358788.83159387
 Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife3295931.162290604
  "What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut190740.2112999561
 "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter58695.70009106782
 At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing247086460.75470504
 Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr18828.43457350688
 Bingley will dance with you at the next ball1549.9473897243436
"  "Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, I'm the tallest1700094.4624072877
"  The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr16296.340511776132
 Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner1983.4945987503536
     CHAPTER III55.98749846980634
   Not all that Mrs156.68490666115363
 Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr7619640.372470299
 Bingley33.49371635676596
 They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas54123284.27735626
 Her report was highly favourable165.53839291458655
 Sir William had been delighted with him263.8655253013756
 Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr121435.40257437716
 Bingley's heart were entertained125.8936649214671
 Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for12061856.08827276
"  In a few days Mr593.2586119157268
 Bingley returned Mr89.85839430786909
 The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse710670.9558216907
 Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all6812.383648118166
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c4614311.919823658
 Bennet was quite disconcerted131.70943610944715
 She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be8209798493.159322
 Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly3119.617279149098
 The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin26585277.25705785
 And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr4169.780850879362
 Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man7048.340076824117
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners31418.37458831541
 His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion3812.7672384465877
 His brother-in-law, Mr145.1987551142648
 Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr1808.624208256941
 Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year149653080.4777567
 The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr292552.6759465192
 Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend11820715832636.678
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield42734508.18149941
 Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves382.4690399150105
 What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr1067.7690637678145
 Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party333915099.29659677
 His character was decided162.84183294090144
 He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again1572249.0428235817
 Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs341.15462220056946
 Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters39069.295236094316
 Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr7240.758680734738
 Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it66625.37885747054
  "Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance378031.95617536735
 I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner1439.3809577706652
 You had much better dance269.16784634235484
"  "I certainly shall not248.56961784517128
 You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner5061.452376672162
 At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable8818.167637393564
 Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with71107334.60025692
"  "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty1980492883568.498
"  "_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr184890.72712247388
 Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet546.7111785153645
 Do let me ask my partner to introduce you579.5515048967156
"  "Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, "She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men21824398462646.934
 You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me18205.8683797411
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Bingley followed his advice126.50015033911465
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him4192.099112534041
 She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous240262.7493748416
  The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family1039.8832344591563
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters58754.79031863065
 Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure132.88227967374013
 Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball2945412892.9806156
 They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants220399.81267528213
 They found Mr96.80328329189447
 Bennet still up106.7770305915942
 With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations15702177.022371866
 He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear5957548.815136878
 Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball3981109.2416232144
 I wish you had been there509.892088052856
 Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it1262.3720288180382
 Every body said how well she looked; and Mr499.48346998549107
 Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice585.7022827521376
 Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time94790343.53976041
 First of all, he asked Miss Lucas1356.7202717722846
 I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance165630827866.75592
 So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next85875.14568874959
 Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"  "Oh! my dear," continued Mrs2686113.5305035943
 Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him5174.968968427521
 He is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women2078.202791473994
 I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses2696.5166090934363
 I dare say the lace upon Mrs359.0315271350267
 Hurst's gown----"  Here she was interrupted again8406.646270228945
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Bennet protested against any description of finery202.40750570264348
 She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr142419.1142090512
 Darcy19.074490057073533
  "But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing4305835431.085146
 I quite detest the man167.12277783625757
"     CHAPTER IV59.279486696303046
   When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr85151.28517209821
 Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him2983.836241282917
  "He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"  "He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can6534630520179050.0
 His character is thereby complete168.5475857318237
"  "I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time9959.257572179637
 I did not expect such a compliment895.9174036326298
"  "Did not you? _I_ did for you4705.265749322864
 But that is one great difference between us764.7733263199232
 Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never63928.87942358969
 No thanks to his gallantry for that314.1896570554968
 Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him18675.85937915187
 You have liked many a stupider person241.56601467988457
"  "Dear Lizzy!"  "Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general7375200.214976583
 You never see a fault in any body381.91423871458375
 All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes1065.191743883746
 I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life4456.587093156542
"  "I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think304758.62390053604
"  "I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder129876.69825097162
 With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where2110386.61882925
 But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone191851.71503431402
 And so, you like this man's sisters too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his33117.05163126465
"  "Certainly not; at first236.3123934984575
 But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them1028.4735901855254
 Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her6199353.825837804
"  Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them1043649247825.0922
 They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited5941649.892027862
 They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others1992806328422.1848
 They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade167971.0620189686
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it1492064.1926782096
--Mr40.23329989237047
 Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase1176553272889.9407
 Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her275502.69107446173
 Mr7.838204499203478
 He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately9362685.854127359
  Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character220139.56363598068
--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied6415046.232661738
 On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion50554.64448527228
 In understanding Darcy was the superior258.4458844782852
 Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever2168.6719864144507
 Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence2807.590038171674
  The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic3262.3984676070518
 Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful1751893936904.6614
 Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure40910050.64038905
 Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much4729.238720241112
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of535829400.06263494
 Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose326317.7785782912
     CHAPTER V54.81308000413998
   Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate5042.002261405885
 The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly238.0520042016493
 It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world3697913522706.6533
 For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body346988.0756056796
 James's had made him courteous230.71645327743892
  Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs132521.53750189248
 Bennet26.587121706548537
--They had several children167.77768657925733
  That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate16304767.123678684
  "_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs13588.273827841853
 Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas348.6719599436561
 "_You_ were Mr399.90529743941613
 Bingley's first choice108.15542305615979
"  "Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better621.645647383076
"  "Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice1374.8820484683872
 Robinson80.83110884667683
"  "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr687.7650538316931
 Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr2248.8989106965705
"  "Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know17673.88788326155
"  "_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said Charlotte611808.8341530575
 "Mr16.23186713533009
 Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_25410.120341660648
"  "I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him40928844.49763302
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips23384.7502478681
"  "Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said Jane7717.959186273047
--"I certainly saw Mr367.0922185869896
 Darcy speaking to her162.09148338481282
"  "Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to5032763.58062161
"  "Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance1106978.1973182575
 With _them_ he is remarkably agreeable756.0903413027929
"  "I do not believe a word of it, my dear25343.978647207266
 If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs23036.270297954776
 Long55.62223037835014
 Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise28110.16769021829
"  "I do not mind his not talking to Mrs635.8305995300323
 Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza608701.96688514
"  "Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_, if I were you184046456.08508393
"  "I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him70634.48250528748
 One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself1975897.4863371372
 If I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud68032.72121560748
"  "That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_379717683.37845516
"  "Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing I believe381854.31402261165
 By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary1088468770101.1682
 Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously2871.9474912986993
 A person may be proud without being vain420.43563048835404
 Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us5764.951724605291
"  "If I were as rich as Mr590.5704631471185
 Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was1006302.2241544477
 Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly306563.13618534576
     CHAPTER VI54.81308000413998
   The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield1116.9579689591685
 The visit was returned in due form381.0238383999085
 Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the two eldest47016493.10634174
 By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration910293819912.3756
 It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent1.7563212202191206e+21
 She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas972.615727799429
  "It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded1676959358.2798758
 There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself397794.16419364355
 We can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement496073.2479057276
 In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels4100.359358014207
 Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on378734.2160035332
"  "But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow23593.40429743236
 If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too1102396.5928173487
"  "Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do160589.0818427311
"  "But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out696366.4181877571
"  "Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her3837.1093320324385
 But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together588281916.0140117
 Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention9934.318758754906
 When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses339068.6296743019
"  "Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it9636785554.77919
 But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design2966.79551006121
 As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness73637.69214096731
 She has known him only a fortnight333.38765537486944
 She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times2964891.847403692
 This is not quite enough to make her understand his character7875.943105299821
"  "Not as you represent it219.55680099718083
"  "Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded6358418.13865117
"  "Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth3773100089978.9683
 Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance663.4838701803809
 If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least781373.0915989968
 They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life12704946.166962236
"  "You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound14558.847104592944
 You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself320450.6182630656
"  Occupied in observing Mr120.26470567278287
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise170480098.88651502
 But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes98132438.96371946
 To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying330.09105177793117
 Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness26431518194.39936
 Of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with3354373.713455239
  He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others7971718.518062177
 His doing so drew her notice189.45334544999017
 It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled3554.8874492666437
  "What does Mr119.81495965159232
 Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"  "That is a question which Mr22436469.898039255
 Darcy only can answer143.8678513457412
"  "But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about119277.81423483192
 He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him7772745.738928579
"  On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,  "Did not you think, Mr148380836757.21927
 Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?"  "With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic1170025995.0427606
"  "You are severe on us302.0201789787498
 "I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows49394.480968816984
"  "You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers924600665162.1252
" On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must5788034.290708018
" And gravely glancing at Mr153.6003752635994
"  Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital1826.2869030654945
 After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display415093851773.31055
  Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached34252640.31350335
 Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began2425252126.217884
  "What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr1000.4187316280802
 Darcy!--There is nothing like dancing after all247.32832843221735
--I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies8252.088920733699
"  "Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world8060.459218532765
"  Sir William only smiled175.1779364707834
 "Your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr635683.1611565071
 Darcy19.074490057073533
"  "You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir3538.0908471470057
"  "Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight2526.9148175236483
 Do you often dance at St189.5573832497665
"  "Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"  "It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it289280366.2640285
"  "You have a house in town, I conclude?"  Mr7824.100976142713
 Darcy bowed86.82421891703066
  "I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas2532616.754311364
 Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner47733.903217615436
--You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you35888.04601852314
" And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr7716.6014831492985
 Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,  "Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing86124292193.39413
--I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner12260.477572685746
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain16113.891183331
 Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion3322.409163861549
  "You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour451422890138.09607
"  "Mr27.541780616983342
 Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling3962.7764946672664
 Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,  "I can guess the subject of your reverie712120239.9685886
"  "I should imagine not180.19819580111954
"  "You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion374003.58038345305
 I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"  "Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you22090629.957583457
 My mind was more agreeably engaged250.51992299853663
 I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow108373.3760258372
"  Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections88736.80908687502
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy replied with great intrepidity,  "Miss Elizabeth Bennet1286.2111590640968
"  "Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley803.9694554175808
 How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you joy?"  "That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask4371885.441384827
 A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment10320.999366172098
 I knew you would be wishing me joy481.30740843791034
"  "Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled1314593.4105464595
 You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you781141.8616200614
"  He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long23525792.041797712
     CHAPTER VII54.81308000413998
   Mr7.838204499203478
 Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his456267376.0929362
 Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds38529.386045299594
  She had a sister married to a Mr673.8252805720703
 Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade25379509.675338786
  The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way191460460.57660297
 The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt1039882525461.382
 At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters312398950.28944397
  Their visits to Mrs119.64783392113465
 Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence958.0467143438902
 Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections3684.5913216090084
 Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves60934.833702622695
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before9419.806696882451
 They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr999.4807198561899
 Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign100841.24385628621
  After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr1950.181894650976
 Bennet coolly observed,  "From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country3351715.7718715747
  "I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs4927.6516871080485
 Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly86040.1091898206
 If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however44384.88433805122
"  "If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it6516.957003719037
"  "Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever4575.311684550946
"  "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree108330.00718934352
 I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish624979.8969487865
"  "My dear Mr111.99004980515804
 Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother181755.4834051554
--When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do54394.400840312825
 I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals216249971608.20407
"  "Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library59717605.49639361
 Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer764627.6073071011
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,  "Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love241485904491.12628
"  "It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud892376.7699152478
       "My dear Friend,       "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and      me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our      lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never      end without a quarrel4511024058.491481
 Come as soon as you can on the receipt of      this6027.151998596256
 My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers5134.496452194118
      Yours ever,       "CAROLINE BINGLEY242.52819931651032
"  "With the officers!" cried Lydia1852.938367304177
 Bennet, "that is very unlucky1697.3528445448555
"  "Can I have the carriage?" said Jane10223.83178391246
  "No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night5904066.50201887
"  "That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home13948099.858617293
"  "Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr786.5574770868049
 Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs17046.739860313763
"  "But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure19833.06191756307
 Bennet, are not they?"  "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them145589.1145716522
"  "But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered213994.52730970085
"  She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged4230.759852221268
 Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day1112115.6522083948
 Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard9278.119013161737
 The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back3257.345702106487
  "This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs5356.622909223404
 Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own61549.69085452791
 Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance2792570.006485969
 My kind friends will      not hear of my returning home till I am better2315.7288016800117
 They insist also on      my seeing Mr190.89609909841147
 Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear      of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache      there is not much the matter with me534157.5660427947
       "Yours, &c65.08088488885085
"  "Well, my dear," said Mr2383.2012680986586
 Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr6356875178.332461
 Bingley, and under your orders245.01717669075632
"  "Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying22022.582329701898
 People do not die of little trifling colds288.4682786782475
 As long as she stays there, it is all very well12728.473264375376
 I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage72548.41013265506
"  Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative1411901113.5394187
  "How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there48240882159.26402
"  "I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want4944.922283526679
"  "Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?"  "No, indeed74179291.7117757
 I do not wish to avoid the walk2387.9193028616055
 The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles1672.2885939505882
 I shall be back by dinner326.17566407980553
"  "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required211499586.1756329
"  "We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia371855.46548654936
--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together21521.69328999015
  "If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes3632080.3737358376
"  In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise256798652585.70724
--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs2746193.4393232716
 Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it36690.69557922112
 She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness14480289.075533427
--Mr40.23329989237047
 Darcy said very little, and Mr584.3234177150298
 Hurst nothing at all139.51129992619744
 The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone249592.98667461798
 The latter was thinking only of his breakfast347.34483920279
  Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered929.0722076669806
 Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room221229.15523427294
 She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with20927140.729460545
 Elizabeth silently attended her144.16867587023125
  When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane41978871.046639174
 The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts113200646511.82767
 The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely36721.49144890807
 Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere2553837.5849902835
  When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so34128.66767892765
     CHAPTER VIII45.44094002286213
   At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner14816.150870331636
 To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr208309.17625556383
 Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer14829.366078009067
 Jane was by no means better728.9570557328985
 His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others7052757.696611241
 She had very little notice from any but him482.4406989488084
 Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr281.1372207443732
 Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr5482.212769985014
 Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her57747575.77931529
  When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room25211965.749767274
 Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty3995490.866802439
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Hurst thought the same, and added,  "She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker10747572.81384919
 I shall never forget her appearance this morning451.2190380792948
"  "She did indeed, Louisa637.8703285935061
 I could hardly keep my countenance409.30566468430055
 Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"  "Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office174504867450651.22
"  "Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was all lost upon me497056.3029199784
 Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice172.5980207385814
"  "_You_ observed it, Mr557.4563484146089
 Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition1032814811.0443583
"  "Certainly not105.35208973655739
"  "To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum2680988909.1972184
"  "It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley235647.3482159606
 Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes5154739.040764833
"  "Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise93807.89228718035
"--A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs1546.5537902917517
 Hurst began again100.65933174267634
  "I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled4136966.911537808
 But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it2271945.4794854564
"  "I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton50822.075451750134
"  "Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside3521.758642657934
"  "That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily90681.17898304117
"  "But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy588694.1871694579
  To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations687979.7749396912
 She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself245843829439.52615
 Hurst looked at her with astonishment666.3717615211705
  "Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular93251.05723036465
"  "Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards37343.4745714753
 She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else4045.4865997730244
"  "I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things62729634.36988538
"  "In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well109880060.87146564
"  Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying41961.3645590442
 He immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded1514.4316134243254
  "And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into1641003402.152539
"  Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room7903.43633979526
--What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr1471.1038499707495
 Darcy!"  "It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations17143852.288433
"  "And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books34812.53434059317
"  "I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these2095.6954420188417
"  "Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place33790.25708312633
 Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley177639.136369417
"  "I wish it may295.7355231873681
"  "But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model122881.96545267687
 There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire764.5351736992019
"  "With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it3518.9839987975515
"  "I am talking of possibilities, Charles367.0407525902713
"  "Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation29839.182034518188
"  Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr13031510.145202799
 Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game2490.361891196711
  "Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will she be as tall as I am?"  "I think she will82040307.98891135
 She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller691.7091529974625
"  "How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much23191.902712219526
"  "It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are58553371.38285596
"  "All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"  "Yes, all of them, I think14808999.772748543
 They all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses225.9482742753572
"  "Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth131524.11649657166
 The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen6579.191879184234
 But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general15952.43279715769
 I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished200758.21032631613
"  "Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley34398.81139964421
  "Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman1969879.579187687
"  "Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it2834.8515060083237
"  "Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with526298.390299656
"  "All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading167864240.96504426
 I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_315.3125796486084
"  "Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?"  "_I_ never saw such a woman115321646.26909395
 _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united115009.76048042074
"  Mrs21.994241784043503
 Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr69138.20244882074
 Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward2925.3025585577725
 As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room3750.211027727816
  "Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds927247504221.7578
 But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art52770.86133186405
"  "Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation2975042.8294958263
 Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable167.70079783619437
"  Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject24215.94184698437
  Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her2342830.9775134814
 Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians904596.033110433
 This, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr89883501.40939924
 Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better15646.374612678983
     CHAPTER IX83.2924110012769
   Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr178668059.08022782
 In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation28208738.492115058
 The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with854.4425248934892
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast2507.351082538068
  Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs554.827776226306
 Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield186639052.6391302
 She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable414997.6482228698
 After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour120225.37177909214
 Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs227.71951778294593
 Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected854.8047279175446
 "She is a great deal too ill to be moved3650.414813451352
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Jones says we must not think of moving her1546.8513524648533
 We must trespass a little longer on your kindness724.3086797467819
"  "Removed!" cried Bingley1031.6254422103802
 "It must not be thought of745.5218396703353
 My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal38966.864355003614
"  "You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us59671944.52784301
"  Mrs21.994241784043503
  "I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with6.241402716333456e+16
 I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_1823.3661625391708
 You have a sweet room here, Mr506.91844700514383
 Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk1999.648495997338
 I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield11126.604694226964
 You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease528853.9686225109
"  "Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes33623655.46218801
"  "That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth39208.03765936491
"  "I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful910962.255467737
"  "That is as it happens394.6917621112197
 It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours7602.885617738544
"  "Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home20005377.82006989
 It must be an amusing study664.3513164512811
"  "Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing628.902448022506
 In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society1897.9770935406934
"  "But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever23143.274591056037
"  "Yes, indeed," cried Mrs2036.752814262291
 Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood1117.946953219643
 "I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town383420.9990474867
"  Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away203520.4828119948
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph2178.790091473296
  "I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places23631.819937947315
 Bingley?"  "When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same107821293303.65393
"  "Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother133848.21095739325
 "You quite mistook Mr129.59944109259305
 Darcy19.074490057073533
 He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true4756065.0329693025
"  "Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger5495722.778121902
 I know we dine with four and twenty families352.7928042973609
"  Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance1358.2353543874617
 His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr1292.6675514310846
 Darcy with a very expressive smile378.78203183766317
 Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away2300022.6290875673
  "Yes, she called yesterday with her father2011.1067682272605
 What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr439.1688274260461
--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter74491.1439762811
"  "Did Charlotte dine with you?"  "No, she would go home100911.19946728059
 I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies302.2118100911486
 For my part, Mr195.3862005534669
 Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently60354.98110947961
 But every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you581510.1515011593
 It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend252250.02357771897
"  "She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley12543.14387204905
  "Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain4183.174223183165
 Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty1085.5618174533022
 It is what every body says387.35141135812063
 I do not trust my own partiality542.2780997575239
 But however he did not528.1730854891924
 Perhaps he thought her too young293.74686324528335
 However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were67168.8165255074
"  "And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently8928.413641504272
 "There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way16840.000519240144
 I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"  "I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy55921563.75007061
  "Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may604.0551663045005
 Every thing nourishes what is strong already242.11050498247735
 But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away222264.11697442798
"  Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again33051.76292118154
 She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs512268.1706253896
 Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr190.93148139124227
 Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy29429.631404095224
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required98320.50360524828
 She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs392.21219643502485
 Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage1139.514469814004
 Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward1997.2452941218132
 The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr43989401.525596
  Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age2647801.887137524
 She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance117962626.53458492
 She was very equal therefore to address Mr387.3258095793997
 Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it689985651.8381262
 His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear1100.1672560243378
  "I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball75621122.53485051
 But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill4771.438421373071
"  Lydia declared herself satisfied162.9627030953735
 "Oh! yes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again729216.2146204516
 And when you have given _your_ ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also2037108.8485305111
 I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not30341.15167208263
 Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_885216240.9710691
     CHAPTER X45.44094002286213
   The day passed much as the day before had done2540.211325900018
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room25008213.54103174
 The loo table, however, did not appear6856.1213207678375
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister9990805.08381169
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Hurst and Mr82.66591727360652
 Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs226.52698914013882
 Hurst was observing their game131.3917235080955
  Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion51650.1764401553
  "You write uncommonly fast150.56956604109783
"  "You are mistaken152.43747851512063
 I write rather slowly121.49993209688233
"  "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!"  "It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours5535243428.946419
"  "Pray tell your sister that I long to see her1774.4485729590965
"  "I have already told her so once, by your desire2477.554786637271
 Let me mend it for you233.31381415480993
 I mend pens remarkably well131.99567824801963
"  "Thank you--but I always mend my own270.0139480381039
"  "How can you contrive to write so even?"  He was silent4604.250332643227
"  "Oh! it is of no consequence1634.7908455839588
 I shall see her in January295.90379786542013
 But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr2457.3328843511003
 Darcy?"  "They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine995685.9588722069
"  "It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill443060.2901331384
"  "That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease2107491.346072786
 He studies too much for words of four syllables630.3028854043678
--Do not you, Darcy?"  "My style of writing is very different from yours103519.80573422184
 He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest721.8032131095357
"  "My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents182775.71596097288
 Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof2916.01683345398
"  "Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility111796.25274979173
 It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast2565.4984835602327
"  "And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"  "The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting3021556550.7689505
 The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance93670.03296883212
 When you told Mrs153.27129667891165
 Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"  "Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning1.8506300111565156e+16
 And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment2035325.4597340457
"  "I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity4469097.326719886
 Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month1091131442682.1846
"  "You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr96343.34416313402
 Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition2676.2388947823915
 You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself1798.3934523127502
"  "I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper1655589.2758808732
 But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could13054006558.778671
"  "Would Mr99.14215438310205
 Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"  "Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for himself1448931.0194540508
"  "You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged82577.46124097587
 Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety2056190393217.9849
"  "To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you2472.5055856898543
"  "You appear to me, Mr1024.5021317997578
 A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it9371.85763873528
 I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr12901.432130287898
 Bingley33.49371635676596
 We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon75325.80455064408
 But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"393527932.5507198
   "Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"41826224.029324375
  "By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of1638060731.2242835
 I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference1764555.6955695234
 I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do155700489.69910696
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh509144.3387632703
 Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense12329.350748113699
  "I see your design, Bingley," said his friend12193.870734458826
--"You dislike an argument, and want to silence this1372.4976064315822
 Arguments are too much like disputes318.40350593691835
"  "What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr527662.212281968
 Darcy had much better finish his letter271.57804025569123
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter576.9549336342102
 Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself1229749.6645706813
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr2838991.729274801
 Darcy's eyes were fixed on her345.13074967105877
 She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange454240957.06446034
 She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present37395840.6030574
 The supposition did not pain her208.19672654207736
 She liked him too little to care for his approbation1033.0435737417665
  After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr8175.310929002299
 He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence1970.4651998571535
  "Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply10935115.676286975
 You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt310055418.581433
 I have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare1448337.4594323002
"  "Indeed I do not dare1093.016702540423
 He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger94923.03604381953
  Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth1969019.884991662
  She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance38869.790941022504
  "I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers36329238194210.63
--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses294864.21066846565
 Put them next to your great uncle the judge444.83223038300036
 They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines18669.398280363916
 As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"  "It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied1903938448702.506
"  At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs3624.252386929224
 Hurst and Elizabeth herself147.66815509318934
  "You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs515.3896698129472
 Hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out9416.655451393963
"  Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr183.83851915483066
 Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself582.4538608068052
 The path just admitted three143.53943222815707
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,--  "This walk is not wide enough for our party19416.320555372717
 We had better go into the avenue549.0055994665342
"  But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered,  "No, no; stay where you are21108968.941960875
--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage493.6568517731203
 The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth247.499068142595
 Good bye62.064654824518854
"  She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two396956.7628395519
     CHAPTER XI56.24636485292475
 Their powers of conversation were considerable212.96850088452487
  But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object19426.452967824927
 Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps1015144.6568505001
 He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr34626.262596055
 Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation315488.76436672575
 He was full of joy and attention282.06333954840045
 The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door1285638285.3666754
 Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain267.802251340595
 She had obtained private intelligence that Mr164.21370871172286
 Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr532.5363494578729
 Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected210.33895432830496
 She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her9718570.3061458
 Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs1261.4707201343786
 Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet12817.125191045754
  Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr1189.775388290356
 She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on260447.65326898466
 At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library4.2780674343438483e+17
"  No one made any reply278.3607844204572
 She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,  "By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure1.8707983495686444e+16
"  "If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards2695895691937.278
"  "I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting137910360.96802032
"  "Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball3093515.284048412
 Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious210136.18587808614
--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude14465.21249937763
"  Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately695.3345387853482
 Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr3177.253971265252
 Darcy looked up118.88035494933642
 He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book52218.74805551766
 He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere78958625.3817535
 "What could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?  "Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it1402100663622.2776
"  Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr8816.593924440067
  "I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak2827549.5807964616
 "You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire4841577878.187752
"  "Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley1381.0973970723758
 "I never heard any thing so abominable820.0647511141252
 "We can all plague and punish one another374.7718243821938
 Teaze him--laugh at him129.19076166789168
--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done68640.62295246244
"  "But upon my honour I do _not_1639.4784170623777
 I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_6427.996811141893
 Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no--I feel he may defy us there6599.471703926087
 And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject121884.11983418917
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy may hug himself107.51409458298424
"  "Mr27.541780616983342
 Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth5170.613650129771
"  "Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be145047.69664275536
 The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke1644727.3556655985
"  "Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of _them_4087644.841161061
 I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good609.0100698217947
--But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without5932.752528062497
 But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule22196.559521076404
"  "Such as vanity and pride332.19509690038245
"  Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile333.89409880143603
 Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"  "I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr20021377.623858977
 Darcy has no defect142.06489641399068
 He owns it himself without disguise170.14733655689236
"  "No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension17815.70654117296
 I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding29415.96681069752
--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world2366.584685374274
 I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself21262.649323046815
 My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them1004.2179362294545
 My temper would perhaps be called resentful253.14430050845647
--My good opinion once lost is lost for ever379.0803112510588
"  "_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth661.0287735864111
--I really cannot _laugh_ at it371.25005010319813
 You are safe from me180.6619012289921
"  "There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome696513.1516221943
"  "And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body2643.02915099104
"  "And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them55739.90446748673
"  "Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share716389.5062581025
--"Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr3823.837639525935
"  Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it40207554.100164674
 He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention1640.0976606620804
     CHAPTER XII45.44094002286213
   In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day132358021.29118097
 But Mrs54.60913655680727
 Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home1585808.5546850548
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr1118489.5193468817
 Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well27103.992341267636
--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr71279569.06479938
 Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made3671301.2316671526
  The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred2421494.732734774
 Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other523905.9316316633
  The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right53020139150.810585
 Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough975.1677695016151
 She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself269867.0812691694
 He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it263401603.07102326
 Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her6363643079.892629
  On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place6680.02246233044
 Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former73309982464.18869
--Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits9009.480709492935
  They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother683.2084768926409
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again394268.490481191
 The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth12384876.42240868
  They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to1142263.0169809335
 Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort3239.3167664292046
     CHAPTER XIII74.13126018818161
   "I hope, my dear," said Mr7888.581056444474
 Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party4007178440.8588367
"  "Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her10505224006.041445
"  "The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger26345.684832698833
" Mrs21.994241784043503
 Bennet's eyes sparkled91.8180673047306
 Bingley I am sure285.90714038924455
 Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr1897208.1118257118
 Bingley33.49371635676596
--But--good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day8535.391557606888
 Lydia, my love, ring the bell465.0306815963011
 I must speak to Hill, this moment543.0521023456079
"  "It is _not_ Mr804.1509673186222
 Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life7809486.278998466
"  This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once189838.32570232483
  After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained1259.1316391985772
 "About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention3157555.200276824
 Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases884936.3796778618
"  "Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned1048295.1112918215
 Pray do not talk of that odious man687.0753194677766
 I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it473252868032.42206
"  Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail6491.112241797056
 They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs29156.241697460817
 Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about36559121.75395574
 Bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr870.603529894869
 Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn196.83859804179951
"  "No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical7310998059.82874
 I hate such false friends142.5247431705364
 Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?"  "Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear2563915117.1052012
"       _Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,       15th October328.760491066914
_       DEAR SIR,       The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured      father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the      misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the      breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing      lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good      terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at      variance636777513107722.2
--"There, Mrs204.92829535483793
 Bennet26.587121706548537
"--My mind however is now made up on      the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been      so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right      Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,      whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable      rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to      demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be      ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are      instituted by the Church of England468791846071328.9
 As a clergyman, moreover, I      feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in      all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds      I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly      commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the      entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,      and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch23659960641817.164
 I cannot be      otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your      amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to      assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but      of this hereafter99441200.18514684
 If you should have no objection to receive me      into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on      you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and      shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday      se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as      Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a      Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the      duty of the day25822338179942.66
"  "At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said Mr44009.9985316338
 Bennet, as he folded up the letter1163.3966987057975
 "He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again609341960.8398842
"  "There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him204433815.62719572
"  "Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit12475844.230439741
"  Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required233890.00719309706
 "I cannot make him out403.3980587754952
--There is something very pompous in his style917.1139509079619
--And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could208106.64832851203
--Can he be a sensible man, sir?"  "No, my dear; I think not458243.3264076656
 I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse500.7962094270246
 There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well5940.768084172049
 I am impatient to see him665.6997052085529
"  "In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem defective108309.26350125052
 The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed73647.16206708789
"  To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting11124.636304520709
 Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters3614020.7122856854
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr35801.27659833474
 Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself1664.7887194648774
 He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty5098.214192166232
 His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal10504.20497209841
 He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs1472.5592784050796
 Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage5831520029.111501
 This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs16057.222255318255
 Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,  "You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough1372913817.6607192
 Things are settled so oddly156.04528579932438
"  "You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate691.085743569102
 It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess9500.468894878008
 Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world140967.20642378792
"  "I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate39793770.20284282
 But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them5387.047920663642
 At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted----"  He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other434316254.90938663
 They were not the only objects of Mr719.955032953581
 Collins's admiration91.78190506994784
 The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs802676.4840383657
 Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property7077.591228962329
 The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing335783.80175862793
 But here he was set right by Mrs208.77180776781142
 He begged pardon for having displeased her225.4404049453799
 In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour191342.1839846588
   During dinner, Mr147.44245334264235
 Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable10378.365627733889
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins was eloquent in her praise258.5368455759168
 The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine23328740125.034626
 She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening8395135.827607295
 Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her227509.86099742606
 She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations1105290280.590653
 She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs10731297403.156261
  "That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs97938.41105773186
 It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her3506.7504708499187
 Does she live near you, sir?"  "The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence3796716.090530908
"  "I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?"  "She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property217079959.27894124
 Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls1916.176743218727
 And what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?"  "She is a most charming young lady indeed1591831.64572815
 Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth6604067.262885481
 She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them74156462.93658487
 But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies9800.543794111121
"  "Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court20102.024132771767
"  "Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament8446335.627501223
 Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies4832687.285157165
 I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her739049071.5998249
"  "You judge very properly," said Mr965.6661006500494
 Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy21162.632483399677
 May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"  "They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible216506420999.74475
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Bennet's expectations were fully answered137.973507566618
 His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure597093853.2694244
  By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr473.8742157416625
 Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies2467990.1681922385
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels78492942.66386962
--Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed3978.1778319261266
--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons2191.724639004918
 Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,  "Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him5996468850.502012
 My aunt told me so herself on Saturday565.3657739406891
 I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr188173.21194550616
 Denny comes back from town164.21236142167325
 Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,  "I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit4096584.239135038
 But I will no longer importune my young cousin409.5085571547961
 Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon389.2183762643749
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements3532.040853358818
 Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr648636.0341722245
 Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr52520.54522051395
 Bennet, and prepared for backgammon280.9029813237075
     CHAPTER XV45.44094002286213
   Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance2056498456442.007
 The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity3912256431.2256885
 A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility65456319917353.87
  Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report442846887187.08344
 This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part1000585.0390923187
  His plan did not vary on seeing them648.2629956067519
 The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs72617.13612702994
 Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on307377230.76229936
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while Mrs1574.6137125677558
 Bennet was stirring the fire137.86738773049518
 Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course2364.5984840504348
 Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces5772743292.601068
 Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr1830.1129650998657
 Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr851746.2262326711
 Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr984160.3119868542
 Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford5936.262772821263
 Such doings discomposed Mr101.7786251723699
 In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr530857114454.7605
 Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr826.9867873038846
 Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go50669.47614782541
  In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton54167.13605255304
 The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_18191.682399617956
 Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them7294208.333589945
  But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way34313000.289868586
 The officer was the very Mr215.47748752053755
 Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed28181.47887133241
 All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot9197456241.456923
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps4248347.644762789
 This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming153154.2270667679
 His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address4272553.8075820645
 The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street6094962966.701077
 On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities132518.30698372016
 Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object3399.293155484256
 He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her90981.21009393506
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting309216326351.888
 Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red978.5549470380995
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr2513.1264709230895
 Darcy just deigned to return163.72619860829917
 What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know473704.8626470177
  In another minute Mr106.69299854789516
 Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend17810.03186154391
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr6278.442179487395
 Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs37123562.38336168
 Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation1004.4488621523406
 Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr71430894372818.33
 Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr314857190.4823719
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire9243825.184651453
 She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr6195048.987796447
" Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr2858635.4475875627
 Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening41036.05995635617
 This was agreed to, and Mrs416.18565571379173
 Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards73801.09700399864
 The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits12530.608079018242
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless176762.75813247467
  As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister2351410372.9927173
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs367.9949904348529
 Bennet by admiring Mrs98.2161796552722
 Philips's manners and politeness121.34500122171545
 Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life12139525.92123178
   As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr28670.80783484971
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr502191803.0788139
 Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house19027.368554948618
 Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs34835188896.05
 Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room58367729117.128334
  In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs11406545751.56325
 Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could8985692.790065138
 To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long301238340.83553547
 It was over at last however225.80997915857841
 The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr1352.263450892877
 Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration16589106.721566468
 Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room3417415.1818973497
 Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker87987887021899.12
  With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr2797.7424134505445
 Wickham and the officers, Mr421.9832958635887
 Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs296399.8213425348
 Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin9406.713871700784
  When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist85887.06941456742
  "I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs7260880374.017341
 Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason2899.017705240106
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia62700.308599191194
 At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular2762258015.1013513
 Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr1130.6795616119123
 Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr10277275088.083517
 Darcy19.074490057073533
 She dared not even mention that gentleman318.4484071042075
 Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved208.94406410045718
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Wickham began the subject himself188.26377960158118
 He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr91755.58389414135
 Darcy had been staying there179.9318065496631
  "About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand2453852872.560955
"  "Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one7734.79449966155
 A clear ten thousand per annum165.8094558315928
 You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy11637795.192026276
  "You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday4202915.551095965
--Are you much acquainted with Mr238.8572161622768
 Darcy?"  "As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable31970978289.965393
"  "I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise10546658.809203275
 I am not qualified to form one361.679522330443
 I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge8288.368781217237
 It is impossible for _me_ to be impartial3237.7804626791904
 But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else101014.0955227311
"  "Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield79283.54906060231
 He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire1571.989066832499
 Every body is disgusted with his pride413.9034093018839
 You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one1975.483436411389
 The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen98374.94725555064
"  "I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man142970.81652976328
" Wickham only shook his head190.83443850661217
  "I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer47637028.76601003
"  "I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield749713.703052836
 I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood1553434.7744697498
"  "Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr8142.889580869054
 Darcy19.074490057073533
 If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go44438.47704042753
 We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is293558039240.5705
 His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr2862.313728616919
 Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr83825853.72787033
 Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections676.572404992377
 His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father5104335.438346846
"  Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry249724.09974902036
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry25718783.630390543
  "It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire39816299.4995071
 I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them202672861.90911594
 Society, I own, is necessary to me738.1618754663734
 I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude27277.918056470113
 I _must_ have employment and society535.3367368267466
 The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now3321941320.4907165
"  "Indeed!"  "Yes--the late Mr1024.7731249941264
 Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift1422.5305312960334
 He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me897.6139601699192
 I cannot do justice to his kindness362.8856799172219
 He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere11170591.382525554
"  "Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?"  "There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law12614639566.861061
 A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr9061.947509528327
 Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing3232983.504305899
 I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely27576265.42941856
 I can recal nothing worse154.499499769271
 But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me94264.16973461663
"  "Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_34095.10754073482
 Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_29115.63050562222
"  Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them14689.505257094215
 Had the late Mr122.4156999073918
 Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life592791.8459846799
 He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me68873.23532633332
"  "I had not thought Mr585.8453846483919
 Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"  After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper1.8543657419167635e+17
 His disposition must be dreadful285.4610489716279
"  "I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can hardly be just to him7588471.612242486
"  Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"  "We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care2.5217353574089147e+23
 _My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr2526.783682636391
 Philips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr35723.800699221574
 Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property3304.5768462121146
 He was most highly esteemed by Mr233.42980187277453
 Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend564.9575464144413
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, Mr54637.714660504505
 Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself87930853.25648549
"  "How strange!" cried Elizabeth1314.1077328895321
 "How abominable!--I wonder that the very pride of this Mr607.502913435108
"  "It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend9560.26387048954
 It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling871.6466034642308
 But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride529432.6730492241
"  "Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"  "Yes23736.33599410109
 Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this1163966.6742799634
 Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive378070.3486923172
 He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers121868957.75378872
"  "What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"  He shook his head29413.226148069003
--"I wish I could call her amiable1077.035012303448
 It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy1545.882036264587
 But she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud1417.833375809775
--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement6006935.870497831
 But she is nothing to me now665.9208221021775
 Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education184434.7244997159
"  After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,  "I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr38409371.65880687
 Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other?--Do you know Mr4915582.144167756
 Bingley?"  "Not at all2377.7740493069023
"  "He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man3745.3088569722295
 He cannot know what Mr203.84849176665932
 Darcy is83.8994329348686
"  "Probably not;--but Mr96.86544960028142
 Darcy can please where he chuses199.99881172309452
 He does not want abilities431.1947427200146
 He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while839.5150967139786
 Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous2027376.729799539
 His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure1457836.805539607
"  The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr13233.791041358245
 Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs397.7491416822022
 Philips77.31318780984526
--The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter2547.6879588948327
 It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs64930.280326913984
 Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy594538585.0270847
  "I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object4302985024.388983
 There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters8994153.935431648
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr1046.769743739279
 Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh288919.7092305563
  "Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living170764.8047805348
 I hardly know how Mr281.4676857436528
 Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long9385.100039603209
"  "You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr167617.76371299019
 Darcy19.074490057073533
"  "No, indeed, I did not4023.2883486989203
--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections3616.0947001971776
 I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday3034.7475318857246
"  "Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates25897017.387205232
 Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another3393598.7685817443
 Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman299477362171.6311
"  "I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent527999366319.8478
 She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class26074636428.986103
"  Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr731233914.7381213
 Wickham's attentions97.83735178197345
 There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs786.7708297871269
 Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body7006.308145048836
 Elizabeth went away with her head full of him666.2606691401893
 She could think of nothing but of Mr425.10982514632093
 Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr317756208.94034785
 Collins were once silent114.00361902516573
 Collins, in describing the civility of Mr227.10319027182268
 Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House206270147.61125883
 Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that Mr2040.2083876341649
 Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr404.39696439451757
 Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham3362634.9115466415
--The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained132042932553.03516
  "They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea45498600.413373895
 Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other833.4276508650837
 It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side269288.42600768444
"  "Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody1061031693.7661824
"  "Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion195402.31209803713
 Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for234779.3210720528
--It is impossible270.49898811395155
 No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it114265.02328928837
 Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? oh! no6037.925272386947
"  "I can much more easily believe Mr401.95919594277996
 Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr454.189352551146
--If it be not so, let Mr539.801089038357
 Darcy contradict it97.86785032506556
 Besides, there was truth in his looks1414.9782697872413
"  "It is difficult indeed--it is distressing332.1498716131614
--One does not know what to think1259.2927334433173
"  "I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think403.2056885909324
"  But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr887.2789251785817
  The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr15177849.487835333
 The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation4548370.132281863
 To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs4807.90965485295
 Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others1096468.691438988
 They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs40472.298922267706
 Bennet's civilities91.62202950985966
  The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family6713.202644197498
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr513902.8992702937
 Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card687.5522967079335
 Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr16092.799324077716
 Darcy's looks and behaviour185.4934757952965
 The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr2636715.8246208066
 Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball9886731.16116095
 And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it9732.885943216746
  "While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough241480.93129897487
--I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements2298.1257288494276
 Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body369765.3990889598
"  Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr91876.12262788648
 Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr10024.29121139425
 Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance3876729997195.97
  "I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her1.2186583818295723e+22
"  Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in246.81832138460666
 She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr938.3135263688582
 Collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed337.1473401962686
 There was no help for it however554.7277917280762
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr7937.688473754313
 Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could2138.281408322814
 She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more32716.315065767903
--It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors1456866624.8858404
 The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_8351094975107.456
 Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply49098.83047165817
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him71812.88289729782
  If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once3591922106527.973
 No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy2517.5220177200263
 Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr13225.657871679467
 Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia365861.9586415404
     CHAPTER XVIII77.53454109135588
   Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr1486.408939721419
 Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her23929.850448062327
 She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening512900783.01701105
 But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr1732.15267295675
 Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr20874137.50884414
 Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,  "I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here1104134578876781.2
"  This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make1033891805362.0505
--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham1535.771567058199
 She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr26093636.23775915
  But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice5092091391292083.0
 The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification19963.598799447143
 Mr7.838204499203478
 The moment of her release from him was ecstacy477.12615465629847
 When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr3927394.280744234
 Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him2070122.0574874093
  "I dare say you will find him very agreeable4090.9724663335055
"  "Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me such an evil24941.092248728728
"  When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence115317627698.18517
 Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr871635.9479467754
 They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance383750531482.82
 He replied, and was again silent3867.2156844454335
 After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with  "It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr2319731.2254665075
 Darcy19.074490057073533
--_I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples201502286.8857088
"  He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said29373.14534418575
  "Very well124.40813225837942
--That reply will do for the present669.2110636124027
--Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones1146.110617132916
"  "Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"  "Sometimes22591.455448657867
 One must speak a little, you know1774.084927121637
"  "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"  "Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds2126230033.0956705
--We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb21006364.478323333
"  "This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said he255904.64541178153
 "How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say43971.46194536208
--_You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly2599.4457067128596
"  He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton295115356.539729
 She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance22418070.605419558
"  The effect was immediate178.3834457486939
 A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on42270275.761560954
 At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,  "Mr12784.939211451296
 Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain111723.31866208586
"  "He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life1167482585.9439304
"  Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject2889.3453533279135
 At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr8195340.129770514
 Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner4133.163676638925
  "I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir14005.674303717951
 Such very superior dancing is not often seen395.8025765598048
 It is evident that you belong to the first circles1026.5096408747004
 Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place1147260418908.1074
 What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr421.4170990413944
--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me46251.79586170474
"  The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together626455671.8106198
 Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,  "Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of4548075.055210757
"  "I do not think we were speaking at all1473.491624270684
--We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine210817.99686261427
"  "What think you of books?" said he, smiling4727.371209707419
  "Books--Oh! no120.88585893331967
--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings80573.59520610681
"  "I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject656617.0942666526
--We may compare our different opinions201.31445732291274
"  "No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else2926.2330462074465
"  "The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he, with a look of doubt470899.8261554052
  "Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr16660728918.45063
 You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created_45555.6097601841
"  "I am," said he, with a firm voice37679.47571809514
  "And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"  "I hope not41326.00663790766
"  "It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first39094.85106007205
"  "May I ask to what these questions tend?"  "Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity23580621.90815796
 "I am trying to make it out1029.46730595196
"  "And what is your success?"  She shook her head4472.363560246642
 "I do not get on at all727.4443245960977
 I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly592.034999308671
"  "I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either261432302730.5177
"  "But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity93675.02406659904
"  "I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied22143.567878533962
 She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another25218976041.086727
  They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,  "So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr7.819170195788326e+16
 Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr400039.52241345384
 Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr65976413.07881451
 Darcy in a most infamous manner429.6480666483316
 I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr42576.274478200176
 Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way6821725291245.549
 His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it13715412.998409372
 I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better69051.69614327372
"  "His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr475722975.9863096
 Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself856565.3866913321
"  "I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer45175.89283883359
 "Excuse my interference124.94927252471321
--It was kindly meant152.22478938449487
"  "Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself3704.5686954633265
--"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this24699.83473846601
 I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr1521.4846591616204
 Darcy19.074490057073533
" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley51447.367244121844
--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness117026528.78195132
  "I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr29375918.57718864
 Wickham34.031571574818216
 But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon1212965.4419827443
"  "No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you27308000.31076048
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr206601.32050321987
 Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr743823.7178454809
 Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr245.7487341191258
 Wickham is by no means a respectable young man1289.0651304302846
 I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr9151.490439255153
 Darcy's regard97.73552561422053
"  "Mr27.541780616983342
 Bingley does not know Mr276.518404013924
 Wickham himself?"  "No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton65089.529883133175
"  "This account then is what he has received from Mr1119.5178936799566
 Darcy19.074490057073533
 But what does he say of the living?"  "He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr4427871.841456882
 Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only156669.5528895025
"  "I have not a doubt of Mr916.4328997577499
 Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only299711.4546928292
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before6401141213.271845
"  She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment63560.04822946289
 Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it987309.3533544962
 On their being joined by Mr298.11223423960047
 Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr47026.70151646215
 Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery1784002.8964090783
  "I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness23987097.240863826
 I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine22968737.740281593
 How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before74747165881.09248
 My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology362.72170619336634
"  "You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr1333.3527656533463
 Darcy?"  "Indeed I am3021.498804647712
 I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_1981.0579562880337
 It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night53545.48046456372
"  Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr3447.1461475867713
 Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr11029831450.108349
 Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance1192.312085864428
--Mr40.23329989237047
 Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,  "My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained2.659066281630338e+18
 You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty229238.52043820513
 Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself19662179.155656185
" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr1870.692627281523
 Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident23466.327423913914
 Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh2472470416779.697
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr5074.647350167968
 Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility7060.048628476455
 Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way1995488.9125300068
 Collins then returned to Elizabeth202.00527401718296
  "I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception1101594.2121200524
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention755.5293011407862
 He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily1160660528.7587535
 It was really a very handsome thought866.203366113164
 Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him9336.114930512513
"  As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr480374.3455014993
 Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane151016.3753758094
 She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters12812786.985874752
 Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much742861.1050504267
 Bingley33.49371635676596
--It was an animating subject, and Mrs1234.3155738280873
 Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match1293.4694054127804
 His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do99892535029442.47
 It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked20265237535455.84
 It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs612966.5861208609
 Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life2503.2303027156004
 She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it50960.21538963691
  In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr164547152.42120713
 Darcy, who sat opposite to them434.7831154575631
 Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical335.00041641782866
  "What is Mr220.45424141410822
 Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear7379239140.715718
"  "For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower1407.4175841978235
 Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing1455.8396105877873
"  Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence41847.449020516215
 Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone3598.422692933159
 Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation245.5004859267081
 She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr755.8001603781705
 The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity1918.7866877602023
  At length however Mrs99.62565633990386
 Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken18663749.53300954
 Elizabeth now began to revive177.50967907677716
 But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company23807777.79838414
 By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song41406096.702597715
 Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected110098.73489665183
--Elizabeth was in agonies181.40297639917287
 She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley161622.91197038567
 She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave3160465.361154152
 She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night6391.384121396469
 He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,  "That will do extremely well, child877085.2213956523
 You have delighted us long enough219.11918868539703
 Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit742.6240549605773
"  Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good19495932.593379945
--Others of the party were now applied to1457.415787482108
  "If I," said Mr1482.8177841518143
--I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to1460857.4139383778
 The rector of a parish has much to do491.0132759741106
--In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron524702.6014106766
 He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible728955224.0051205
 And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment5178573.605536981
" And with a bow to Mr581.4607881781479
 Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room84950.73470111717
--Many stared104.77364646365461
--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr1530.201033145698
 Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr374.9432007462333
 Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man1287746.1133157313
  To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed1.398638024752962e+16
 That his two sisters and Mr403.2866423836518
  The rest of the evening brought her little amusement1236.4981091284478
 Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others211027107.8750831
 In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room198386.87591562766
 He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening38485062370.182
 Collins's conversation to herself132.97290107810153
  She was at least free from the offence of Mr1041.493593226136
 Darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak109619.95618993026
 She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr7415.891522978033
 Wickham, and rejoiced in it425.30279644333103
 Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family8256082.115934385
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 They repulsed every attempt of Mrs148.75109578930466
 Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr5864006.251132327
 Collins, who was complimenting Mr506.45745238106275
 Darcy said nothing at all184.204351280587
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene474.7228911599049
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other29224.708908858684
 Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs238.08115226717203
 Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn2389412.624172383
  When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs1243.3870657573866
 Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr31672.0203681857
 Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation1405923.2595779372
 Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time510200703.0944564
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four months193830346.26914287
 Of having another daughter married to Mr362.1583737798566
 Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure40908.63054447409
 Bingley and Netherfield104.51502343836448
     CHAPTER XIX56.24636485292475
   The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn835.298933443877
 Collins made his declaration in form171.57325307044044
 Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business502340745433.8527
 On finding Mrs105.86610738369473
 Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,  "May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"  Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs7764941863917950.0
 Bennet instantly answered,  "Oh dear!--Yes--certainly889.515692508568
" And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,  "Dear Ma'am, do not go1645793.4366806594
--I beg you will not go1503.159180330913
--Mr40.23329989237047
--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear35363.62965676712
 I am going away myself217.25467919702692
"  "No, no, nonsense, Lizzy533.4029818602238
--I desire you will stay where you are690.3302399432529
"--And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr2091408.9836655688
 Collins34.01810605666633
"  Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion1624157798.9921663
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr34623.52646931287
 Collins began88.19871585384041
  "Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections2958856.758780732
 You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken48047.85961237209
 Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life36033.129327882314
 But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did719852879.2803994
"  The idea of Mr326.2411525270006
 Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:  "My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish13929190143787.568
 Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness7313347409.1323805
 Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs6849834.003392571
 Collins, you must marry365.4984326940196
 A clergyman like you must marry238.0985959074687
--Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way18857470.59372666
 This is my advice156.9949303845045
 Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her886875.8365058905
' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer8337848792.453101
 You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite5509432.942456779
 Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women9116625.817194112
 But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years1.4451820270379318e+17
 This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem896496.5515262942
 And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection39814.490779773354
 which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to65652.55596813286
 On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married7411017.2151540145
"  It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now585.3251255078569
  "You are too hasty, Sir," she cried12044.51209045317
 "You forget that I have made no answer1908.3248719065955
 Let me do it without farther loss of time807.5605599062703
 Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me624.1230046785648
 I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them2245361.6228395654
"  "I am not now to learn," replied Mr5659.244864787257
 Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time20625098270.00869
 I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long460279.35654716473
"  "Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration353973.49029523577
 I am perfectly serious in my refusal377.7738536838864
--You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so1914290081.7673612
--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation965000.570423291
"  "Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr14175.224123506356
 Collins very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you3284.0433232094606
 And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications25079885.96805522
"  "Indeed, Mr110.81447167192134
 Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary420.10419064003753
 I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise411967.0093153344
 In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach45474839.898357965
 This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled3830.5015009485587
" And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr160933.4521357825
 Collins thus addressed her,  "When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character2.603225363690181e+16
"  "Really, Mr122.90275158313426
 Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly16249.834572962762
 If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one70017415.64919059
"  "You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course787370.3150782585
 My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable871089.0670997577
 My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you363127063296.32623
 Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications11294.939490812376
 As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females87316810.17106847
"  "I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man2984910.88494396
 My feelings in every respect forbid it564.8274467378897
 Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart412501.4822479809
"  "You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable262879422.4189267
"  To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female457279795086.08856
     CHAPTER XX83.2924110012769
   Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs1986.7115270397346
 Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection414739218.9888693
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character40775373858.15568
  This information, however, startled Mrs1764.638582935381
  "But depend upon it, Mr281.5884114138429
 Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be brought to reason18774.211945373896
 I will speak to her about it myself directly654.5334145342548
 Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state192416663.6555642
 If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity7093524.993915018
 Bennet, alarmed103.22297134846345
 "Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these498.4462602421749
 I will go directly to Mr249.23118337305212
 Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure53509.196562295256
"  She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,  "Oh! Mr31931041.738146394
 Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar5464.156566901493
 You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr291.3936241062007
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication1401152.168174315
  "I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech1137026.791298335
 "Of what are you talking?"  "Of Mr13125.47990585785
 Collins and Lizzy109.17080929691036
 Lizzy declares she will not have Mr524.1459752021906
 Collins, and Mr100.75828410399102
 Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy11127.410993061867
"  "And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business1225.478156022892
"  "Speak to Lizzy about it yourself298.37316769794205
 Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him408.8661358075811
"  "Let her be called down278.3592622528108
"  Mrs21.994241784043503
 Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library10427.111316148168
  "Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared8092.725467489514
 "I have sent for you on an affair of importance978.2838583120014
 I understand that Mr131.0703140639853
 Collins has made you an offer of marriage427.3337012111296
 Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was6157.529633355348
 "Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"  "I have, Sir135692.0226689339
"  "Very well124.13516538832476
 We now come to the point607.6951210382247
 Your mother insists upon your accepting it229.23967259567073
 Is not it so, Mrs377.2488267551663
 Bennet?"  "Yes, or I will never see her again24506.82293951763
 From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents38594.9181561036
--Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr11726.723356987472
 Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_18630.423467835895
"  Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs39073.12129287709
 Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed51409.8101588011
  "What do you mean, Mr435.4350991873945
 Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him9444.321280957076
"  "My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request824414.4830590477
 First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room332318.8776331898
 I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be182388.25889425928
"  Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs176366.65329994544
 Bennet give up the point306.9129398438264
 She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns2744.2077275605957
 She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks52253.30606916569
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed1418.678140857907
 He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way937514.4515307533
 His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret177940.47515368782
  While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them12527.524606981451
 She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr1143200767.2444332
 Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him38500.15399220675
"  Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs26840088.25525154
 Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family17809335.03122126
"  Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth2208.4308646902687
  "Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs750.0769520904446
 Bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way301767.4823639793
--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead43799457537.43877
--_I_ shall not be able to keep you--and so I warn you22245.63435937209
--I have done with you from this very day930.3803402552886
--I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word482332119.1068474
 I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children2272.8618317719324
--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body9231.33575292796
 Nobody can tell what I suffer!--But it is always so713.2951981904359
 Those who do not complain are never pitied470.6016000463386
 She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr122243.69638637254
 Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,  "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr45102250937.39485
 Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear3490773.3628735323
 Bennet thus began the projected conversation186.29176869128673
--"Oh! Mr537.894571146114
 Collins!"--  "My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point36580347.46738211
 Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter1311703.0880354054
 Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned714669433.0503552
 Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation56190068.56277878
 Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf1182.5430991878816
 But we are all liable to error406.4854928611138
 I have certainly meant well through the whole affair886.7814613939768
 My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise33271348.555018175
"     CHAPTER XXI89.11803270408161
   The discussion of Mr152.11897604315834
 As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence857716.8261737452
 He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend62078415837755.19
 Bennet's ill humour or ill health182.8087478294067
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins was also in the same state of angry pride1343.4295944033925
 Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it219782.8823216101
 He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay64915.2361858428
  After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr1879.9342180083718
 Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball11041.531436433466
 He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over5296570.622997176
--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed708467.8763247426
  "I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr2472843.7828514283
 Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself1416130882.99957
"  She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her27318066142.573673
 His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother15154365.679726887
  Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately408413.29773270315
 The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages75515288.07237567
 Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs63312892258.080696
 The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again2689987.663990239
 You shall hear what she says217.1014317365714
"  She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr1889512.2077177565
 Hurst had a house164.33554684326066
 The next was in these words464.80233029848137
 "I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence14098281900.911968
 I depend on you for that273.67837580923594
" To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr4809658973.329828
 Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his271541825.6919408
 But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--Mr25915768.263070982
 Bingley will not be detained in London by them1543.7217226678429
 I will read it to you--  "When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel1.9036516503009843e+17
 I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you10078033.230542697
"  "It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter811672.6408582769
"  "It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_13918.11142364949

 I will have no reserves from _you_2345.5730779218306

 Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again2272823.0623531346
 I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister305347367.08803463
--Will you hear it?"  "Most willingly4883.8351973344725
"  "You shall have it in few words443.5345216145935
 Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy220179.3750438124
 She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you243579.61930766847
"  Jane shook her head136.75637479341034
  "Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me7178.076453224033
--No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection1690.666360997225
 Miss Bingley I am sure cannot1025.9661256963973
 She is not such a simpleton826.3082274759611
 Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes7645.078691895463
 But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend8513984500132413.0
"  "If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy3360449.3594513717
 But I know the foundation is unjust560.4349723947377
 Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself2034342.2148065043
"  "That is right181.86016680211193
 Believe her to be deceived by all means1289.5312688922925
 You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer16348.976781142881
"  "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"  "You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him9784580127305398.0
"  "How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate305745.7910500245
"  "I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion112526.45415010504
"  "But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required3886.700951023977
 A thousand things may arise in six months!"  The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt109522.76210047181
 It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one124087560.38995156
  She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect3388546.1262149634
 Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart70386473.02127348
  They agreed that Mrs114.16904827515327
 Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together789054740802.5027
 After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr12512.69665348141
 Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses7928132898.632795
     CHAPTER XXII83.2924110012769
   The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr4876325.321224979
 Collins34.01810605666633
 Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her463.9158622879814
 "It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express5705422.718725128
 This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr111423.10930359185
 Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself254.46322280458907
 Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon28618232.561380994
 But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet55253450.4779296
 He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday28476400980186.062
 His reception however was of the most flattering kind1250.4413526005046
 Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane844364.8345358662
 But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there2752.835649411019
 Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness8499595521212.518
 The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained57819289.59445896
  Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity71112.0843967986
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr11528.218879085585
 Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr6762.6350170820915
 Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St1291657.3814123634
 James's55.815047612262426
 The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion1791.4002863612445
 The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid2884853.9646469755
 Charlotte herself was tolerably composed161.86073711647958
 She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it8899.885134642382
 Her reflections were in general satisfactory269.62343804344897
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary142960.67022362206
 But still he would be her husband649.5138537949643
--Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want72856486.11941054
 This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it693540.2694700222
 Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation6307851.025766082
 She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr16665.16670246339
 Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family181736.5942141606
 A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love422370137753.0964
 Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them281907.43837884837
  "My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible61186704873.07466
"  They were all astonished; and Mr773.8224894456949
 Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,  "But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness292513863.26287293
"  "My dear sir," replied Mr2514.6287996673695
 Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence9667048.89740816
"  "You cannot be too much on your guard1567.781980494878
 Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence16311903431.90552
 As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth96670369.17746091
"  With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return16748.797838997583
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him20715318.931854077
 But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away8386.082071038707
 Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before390713.6458816119
  The possibility of Mr204.79582543070478
 Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,  "Engaged to Mr94003928523433.77
 Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"  The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,  "Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible that Mr5146484023526.461
  "I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr185134.26615199703
 Collins was wishing to marry you205.24356631594492
 But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done27214455.215282038
 I am not romantic you know293.59535067508233
 I never was108.25887391011922
 I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr790.0448493238239
 Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state5569934.15023289
"  Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family20806.49264492853
 Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard126464.99425196265
 It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match28193.685749501383
 The strangeness of Mr103.3444103988037
 She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage161812672.80619133
 Charlotte the wife of Mr128.33971851296627
 Collins, was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen17507314.386051517
     CHAPTER XXIII83.2924110012769
   Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family263457843.30812657
 With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs727323.7689533306
 Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,  "Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know that Mr147684104.26239917
 Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"  Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy57762238218.47987
  Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr3161446877621305.5
 Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London2600.1188634431983
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent718339.2879018657
 In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr1297273.9255737734
 Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off1251383.3860751484
 Nothing could console and nothing appease her227.16136588007203
--Nor did that day wear out her resentment361.4803074714615
 A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter52594856.3408482
 Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!  Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable4.558810595856431e+18
 Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr2607.029729589954
 Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton59427.25913178834
  Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs6368.620054110921
 Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away2962.484642679118
  Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again7224799.6398212
 Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return7717168604.21214
  Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again242848.33134521884
 The promised letter of thanks from Mr254.22506567597586
 After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men3.240920587396612e+23
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs4867.325305057751
 Bennet26.587121706548537
 On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband16219.334693685107
--It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome569179.5494039127
--She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable18467.193407016202
 Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs175.85820921491484
 Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr5268.779010550436
 Bingley's continued absence110.34407667665577
  Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject926.2825398446697
 Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs1438969.8373289073
 Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood2230.5171296626304
  Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away8220.110170195241
 Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring12661125.381886171
 The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment514298525.06352264
  As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to570175935.4947759
 But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used61844065139.11573
 It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity471.2239613535789
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction647678.0949393385
 He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company5706304.995878515
 The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed33782230.99288473
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet was really in a most pitiable state555.4005861407301
 The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of443243.16782153636
 The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her1052.9377170834102
 As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence965.0178455588447
 Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr274772.9083951024
 Bennet were dead103.27951759893556
 She complained bitterly of all this to her husband1861.2588903377393
  "Indeed, Mr111.94165981814437
 Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"  "My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts221518375904274.44
 Let us hope for better things176.42831026559793
 Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor7211.511574374317
"  This was not very consoling to Mrs756.3971826262142
 Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before,  "I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate1430224028.4463797
 If it was not for the entail I should not mind it30719.284627883157
"  "What should not you mind?"  "I should not mind any thing at all74203.93200867358
"  "Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility11690.153420041095
"  "I never can be thankful, Mr494.0935380029067
 Bennet, for any thing about the entail1010.4816862959119
 How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr218314.78559060534

     CHAPTER I46.42458135002346
   Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt1162.9092335754513
 The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country46440697.95241515
  Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort342029371.7782594
 Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter516611.06307410117
 She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr1888.5978625608223
 Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture33606.23650431965
 Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others47905.28489647172
 To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit3029.8026993884173
 It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing98191.75547780734
 She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded690459376451.9937
  A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs326029.49527493585
 Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,  "Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him30722065810.301678
 But I will not repine387.18981100704224
 It cannot last long118.87816274208762
 He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before13683.462872540227
"  Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing2849.8291769546227
  "You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason162052.677535605
 He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all203360.23886287995
 I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with5697.513357018316
--I shall certainly try to get the better935.5101645246675
"  With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself21398836147.034843
 Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you45554.06953301672
 I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve8435.797434194792
"  Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection2748.3592434605316
  "Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair114428.80678313853
 _You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body135949.7836363301
 _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it80333.52575470565
 Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will22219.34024762532
 You need not163.10451779796134
 There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well18639.72339768752
 The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense1849456609.0065937
 I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage21436.405773232815
 It is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!"  "My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these1804964.3294697814
 You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper1927.4794502780362
 Consider Mr87.03406294452165
 Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character298.8903224628039
 My dear Jane, Mr213.17525075597547
 You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas5082.896268681289
 You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness4578417.530447258
"  "I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together1286581237.7369592
 You alluded to something else137.39397254542146
 You mentioned _two_ instances249.97050890982374
 We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured2518.864159748531
 We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect9591.494194334922
 It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us1301.3082754612828
 Women fancy admiration means more than it does380.18866350920865
"  "And men take care that they should759.7205818808658
"  "If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine7280175.249616894
"  "I am far from attributing any part of Mr854.7317233563584
 Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery52645664.55927636
 Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business15667.92090942508
 But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem39093.24312800677
"  "You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him1609.081531900785
"  "I cannot believe it310.3432839489598
 They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride6381712.135770607
"  "Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing102653315.86336331
 They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better11309.104620466773
 But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's110791.99455842802
 What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed363803495.6109379
 By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy6656.566403758056
 Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood246397.4707115393
"  Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr5366.395139820846
 Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them618.3745880380469
 Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity44198769.166808635
 Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day754190690092.0692
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet's best comfort was, that Mr398.21007520932943
 Bingley must be down again in the summer451.37956790233267
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Bennet treated the matter differently169.96399410603757
 "So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find1361485.8193093787
 Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then8828.631906617791
 When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane11332.8644208297
 Now is your time184.07779039905225
 Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country4002.1725606906994
 Let Wickham be _your_ man882.6075040283469
 He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably4666.410575727861
"  "Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me4830.333040684227
 We must not all expect Jane's good fortune366.5375357847686
"  "True," said Mr653.4013391519292
 Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it29358050.290952757
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family47514.21831340446
 They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve29021.445990914646
 The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr3502.927641506134
 Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr228053676.56423095
 Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter1843.164590328669
  Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else Mr14694810.753673587
     CHAPTER II55.98749846980634
   After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr1329.9670871225844
 The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men27968631088.776516
 He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks1876196.7237176322
  On the following Monday, Mrs245.8048313509716
 Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn536159.3817220158
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs735.5892077154367
 Bennet and Mrs85.73898142169558
 Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces52812.799847123024
 Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard3188.531975743117
 They had frequently been staying with her in town893.1138234117459
  The first part of Mrs161.90333223495054
 When this was done, she had a less active part to play15325.56439079788
 It became her turn to listen273.69615491846037
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister1045.517722678886
 Bingley, if she could615.983585046012
 But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr1228835.8237954576
 Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness26975.138363156388
 I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is16135.770964849844
 It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else3063675.445640935
 However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves9799858.517645897
"  Mrs21.994241784043503
 Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation6534201612.874592
  When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject2093.6641654614177
 "It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she172795.4236079649
 Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent40367792.99347116
"  "An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not do for _us_2465958.1369926673
 We do not suffer by _accident_385.8844976110801
 It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before128909895.93910392
"  "But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea125776.91230060246
 It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment27622.386953617297
 Pray, how _violent was_ Mr325.35986274057024
 Bingley's love?"  "I never saw a more promising inclination20101.631035157854
 Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable7476.400850711292
 At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer10805652.878047947
 Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"  "Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt3039764.4373876695
 Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately748492.5914048741
 It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner269042.66848103196
"  Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence8522.875692755373
  "I hope," added Mrs2011.1679702204146
 Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her12099.402488684262
"  "And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr472776.8373309636
 Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr82060626.84465697
"  "So much the better166.9144164902746
 But does not Jane correspond with the sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling111547.10445123227
"  "She will drop the acquaintance entirely333.3497725826461
"  But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless245015749605.0386
 It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions12823994.985376613
  The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement76603404.03225389
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner805842.9336696222
 Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs4667.033910850709
 Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both3595.943277273516
 Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment12310204553732.432
  To Mrs83.6129612784762
 Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers1324.1200607130406
 About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he belonged3622199.732547083
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr607.4747663699832
 Darcy by character perfectly well156.57567706054206
 Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse297.72702051877474
 In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself16586082.927637
 On being made acquainted with the present Mr616.2615607311294
 Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr584522444.4638861
 Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy1219.321347559532
   Mrs9.810835553236354
 Seriously, I would have you be on your guard2540.3282862325655
 I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better31232522327.755543
 But as it is--you must not let your fancy run away with you2160.462971903975
 You have sense, and we all expect you to use it3871.3204239522547
 Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure29704.356517406915
 You must not disappoint your father421.89844949499314
"  "My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed2186.295112612012
"  "Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise9665.139586697836
"  "Well, then, you need not be under any alarm6671.717092799011
 I will take care of myself, and of Mr4934.4596713755645
 Wickham too97.00538768962609
 He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it337800.2400065952
"  "Elizabeth, you are not serious now6281.194251098319
"  "I beg your pardon132.18838231575208
 I will try again166.15021443459685
 Wickham; no, I certainly am not1243.8487003992007
 But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be better that he should not1395236.0298704512
 I see the imprudence of it404.16545372972587
 Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it109734.84008808786
 My father, however, is partial to Mr4963.543618403886
 Wickham34.031571574818216
 In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry1.5503854311743347e+20
 I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object18550.97078570718
 When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing427807.79709149053
 In short, I will do my best1990.103117334768
"  "Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often91193.81440298163
 At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him3421.6426659888803
"  "As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_731998458.5464896
 But do not imagine that he is always here so often5682.150411681245
 It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week6646.913862954578
 You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends16980.47812210226
 But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied10752271.285808906
"  Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented261273672.27991763
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs4699797.286602294
 Bennet26.587121706548537
 His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she "_wished_ they might be happy169706152.01500696
" Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room17351958760.431675
 As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,  "I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza416637.2152453179
"  "_That_ you certainly shall831.1668397806766
"  "And I have another favour to ask1558.3481051668919
"  "I am not likely to leave Kent for some time5908.8383192523415
"  Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit7104.116852607615
"  The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual16693547.303232906
 Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible1683059.9032589502
 Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was8138257552.450499
 Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen18925988490218.914
 She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise13045.744788865226
 The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging378201.7630599917
 It was Mr91.65753766197516
 Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest771664.1660662398
  Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys1726173988.6775477
 Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline15403.150562953573
 She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been lost1294310.1744784683
  "My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street147987510.9649179
"  She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley65780.47707068044
 "I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London2013475433.1908638
 I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her1129.6210908005842
 He was well, but so much engaged with Mr4191.520069834694
 Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him1215.8813809502801
 I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner1606.2060469599255
 My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs1011.111751712274
 Hurst were going out131.43555650265407
 I dare say I shall soon see them here1178.2094115518112
 It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr922.7605520022375
 Bingley her sister's being in town287.0018095493453
  Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him4845.880245240445
 She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention1393795.9281630688
 After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer626001073.3373761
       "My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in      her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have      been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me62235773.53504661
 But, my      dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me      obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour      was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion62697058.88615597
 Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;      and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time43748.501093476174
 When      she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;      she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said      not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so      altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly      resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer1392503527258400.2
 I pity, though I      cannot help blaming her1451.71915093207
 She was very wrong in singling me out as      she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on      her side342725.7927760328
 But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been      acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her      brother is the cause of it11525072.37375799
 He knows of my      being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and      yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to      persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy33460483642.370636
 I cannot      understand it170.40963663581215
 If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should      be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of      duplicity in all this29029549.47833264
 But I will endeavour to banish every painful      thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,      and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt16609408.068853486
 Miss Bingley said something of his never      returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not      with any certainty378211.0567364216
 We had better not mention it353.67532091187053
 I am extremely      glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at      Hunsford4046.147599975186
 Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria5527.475674748256
       "Your's, &c88.73095044840633
 All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over647.2499526957344
 She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions3380.3776181815015
 His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr102964853.68026716
 Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away74126.77966399209
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself1839979.3627909606
 His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else47846.19661057717
 Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it11236683.070628813
 The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence11670107285.600307
 Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy2249403077.999376
  All this was acknowledged to Mrs429.02283417351526
 Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil97856168282.26447
 But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King15061.692171543966
 I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl61882958.67021905
 There can be no love in all this677.334542558575
 Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly209.26084625512775
 Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do2179.762574575506
 They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain21225769.16814928
"     CHAPTER IV59.279486696303046
 March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford372.0567505301415
 She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty211340772.5995947
 Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr5051.311454414112
 Collins34.01810605666633
 Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch256668.13614796946
 She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter3023.3433682228583
 The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be238147.40153490106
  The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter570063604125.5164
  The farewell between herself and Mr218.87311861164608
 Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more1079.4430047270398
 His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing4.847546950533522e+20
  Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable88669.78192418849
 Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise3399366427.6482315
 Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long8244.004990169062
 He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information19735.830819196493
  It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon314551.80916198244
 As they drove to Mr190.56394334475937
 Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever1064143683.0223913
 On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower580667456.0856206
 All was joy and kindness183.75104765226186
 The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres340353.48062852357
 Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection146672140.17460015
 It was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long215011.86517624717
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance6726828.002296958
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well1377.26013308121
  "But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary98736194.73049249
"  "Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary30436603201394.38
"  "If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think1131784.187787321
"  "She is a very good kind of girl, I believe49180.954020522666
 I know no harm of her288.7054170659537
"  "But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune20152.407230582692
"  "A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe7614.056988753085
 If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?"  "_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_110118378.37095468
 It only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling421.49880742555433
"  "Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose39094.958909769775
 _He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish36634.87209630654
"  "No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose36619.29883441663
 I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire1995894.2741098532
"  "Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better39924882.67023058
 I am sick of them all431.85456939927593
 Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all967.7602996907474
"  "Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment1150.7676434113498
"  Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer24087646.677444134
  "We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs15425.354236484327
"  No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful1460873.7809273596
 "My dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour1234679.5512221607
 What are men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing188187057.37904802
 We _will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen19275.963832883528
 Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation237771.3079372416
 Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers1826.7171295611713
"     CHAPTER V82.55313849101614
   Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight522766745431.9611
  When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view1212344.3287284581
 The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side916.8996057859191
 Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants44801.57750084005
  At length the Parsonage was discernible166.20656743339617
 The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving255779.53810542575
 Mr7.838204499203478
 In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other364077.6446967714
 Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received1224018.91670682
 She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family112428840.23806162
 They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment14172549183.162691
  Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him3270508424724.2505
 But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion254719101.3212591
 When Mr39.67534213164871
 Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte48600.828323731876
 Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear4800.448395317798
 After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London, Mr474664373.2060519
 Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself3047193.5321084345
 To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible15154544.05189508
 Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind272186.53324671625
 He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump42548.69454796489
 But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house1209820987.6537724
 Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help38065607683.5466
 It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit299912.36863402574
 When Mr39.67534213164871
 Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten5769576.2394058565
  She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country4189.7125391004065
 Collins joining in, observed,  "Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her12525566347.248337
 She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over1442988.6425730116
 I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here73633.69620896905
 Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming507.6743313600229
 We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home6971.429241931527
 Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us357.49787461779727
"  "Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour4570736.006897929
"  "Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say23315.877757371843
 She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference2862.240964234344
"  The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well277911648797.3989
 She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr4943.210803601937
 Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings2303.6028485933566
 A lively imagination soon settled it all305.14273459913176
  About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her13755975602.327417
 She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,  "Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is4159313509606.381
 Make haste, and come down this moment835.8393004766663
 "I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!"  "La! my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine28304379163.760693
 The old lady is Mrs157.3001430266278
 Jenkinson, who lives with them307.80732614430826
 The other is Miss De Bourgh562.8506631508102
 Only look at her186.5666564997952
 She is quite a little creature379.1527028036104
 Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"  "She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind19708511.73332679
 Why does she not come in?"  "Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does66999.26813973226
 It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in4284.144711005345
"  "I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas12000.04575808935
 "She looks sickly and cross165.30409160237738
--Yes, she will do for him very well3520.26458854072
 She will make him a very proper wife877.1732454403958
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way149376589.66447586
  At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house1743986.801618038
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day54170383.8496686
     CHAPTER VI54.81308000413998
   Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete1010.3984020763672
  "I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings110707148.95490637
 I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen14189.512798151816
 About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon702.4295737948369
"  Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings181779.38235023824
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them17067988.969875265
  When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,  "Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel7750204.750528757
 Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter2766.736723461407
 I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more2240064.245365178
 Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed1905.8156068742026
 She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved1559.304663832365
"  While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner3587627.2976725544
--Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St238588389898.66898
 James's55.815047612262426
  As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park29275.764897548583
 Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh50745795.47868604
--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her222.94268557765363
 She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation7768295.892403106
  From the entrance hall, of which Mr945.833809681522
 Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs16756089.880667662
 Jenkinson were sitting114.94880144422613
--Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs133036.09566797825
 Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary68653281.73972481
  In spite of having been at St603.9358019607183
 James's, Sir William was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look2256769228254.7046
 Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly13712.42248827389
--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome22381.975990329473
 Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank642021.4627106016
 She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr236646.4652821157
 Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented1065819.6885088438
  When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr9627.58885753611
 Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small4334941.4284599405
 There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies1024.7128329930829
 Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs5971764.294101809
 Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes6710804.826135289
  After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, Mr1106664.4081520187
 Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer186466.617007862
  The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr165359.35035952576
--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear8744348976.916548
 But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them202057.57055563788
 The party did not supply much conversation281.1645119665717
 Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time1432195344.597904
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed34623.72265251023
 Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire200926.59298061798
  When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted431061474350.45435
 She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry41663869173.62655
 Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others16980.97724076037
 In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs261.3674512984916
 Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs7386075.001712241
 Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl3131.800076929673
 She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly9066033625459.492
--Lady Catherine then observed,  "Your father's estate is entailed on Mr3488.925320723147
 Collins, I think222.0292610378802
 For your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line6226455.365027214
--Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?"  "A little88064.5558520304
 Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it some day877.6102351138903
--Do your sisters play and sing?"  "One of them does27714.518189919305
"  "Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned1780.3965303728876
--Do you draw?"  "No, not at all13397.560776657168
"  "That is very strange273.976561070415
 But I suppose you had no opportunity1028.2822928825183
 Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters1861.2957414380003
"  "Has your governess left you?"  "We never had any governess29659.84344530038
"  "No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing83451.30483800985
 Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education1838.866177826409
  "Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess you must have been neglected46776.17179293072
"  "Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means85202.70592995941
 We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary17845.77605679006
 Those who chose to be idle, certainly might761.5392323072703
"  "Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one32915655.202789057
 I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it53555.98476198014
 Four nieces of Mrs123.92614627969695
 'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure56894.84840541485
"  "All!--What, all five out at once? Very odd!--And you only the second1041.7368444611675
--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your younger sisters must be very young?"  "Yes, my youngest is not sixteen708888.0769505419
 Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company4412.621366892458
 But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early607363031.9447374
--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first32499.318661423607
"  "Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person356717.7435190026
--Pray, what is your age?"  "With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it62433100.75766281
"  Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence7581669.85056134
  "You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age72276.29671313503
"  "I am not one and twenty596.3856752776953
"  When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed55424.85802630198
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs3170041.4561192445
 Jenkinson to make up her party280.0244137619257
 Their table was superlatively stupid136.61852901167842
 Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs4058.2750107727566
 A great deal more passed at the other table2950.2410957634847
 Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself3014.197801434939
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many42810.40950506157
 Sir William did not say much341.4703512727014
  When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs145302.6384462162
 The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow29273.604751152125
 From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr52690.77096576869
 Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed7514.154651832904
 As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was264991780277.11368
 But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr4122.783170571084
 Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands20490.81960964985
     CHAPTER VII54.81308000413998
   Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with122624165.79452473
 While Sir William was with them, Mr1522.6981107771155
 Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road1.8085477634418344e+16
 The room in which the ladies sat was backwards1039.4421048029544
 Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr2991536696.689758
 Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement1057517.8994837513
 Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day32800016.564575724
 She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out6381971.229026429
 Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours20814336793.66982
 Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits12157967.882033916
 She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs2443952693.2975955
 Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family377.1707285169376
  Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr38461910.154075176
 Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty351623.9271282284
  The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first742011225.1511465
 Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach62334.42342856802
 This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors25261460497.736366
 Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity559626444511.3907
  In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away3617.3747196493964
 Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr901.7432441097307
 Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself1.8386004732329423e+21
  His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr2029.9052990205507
 Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence266501536.6159032
 On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects1138.7965321793718
 Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr99493743.71822026
 Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him194.1858379854077
 Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,  "I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility1106333103.5314171
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me678.6154143029804
 Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman79426.34751952006
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs338850.69557530066
 Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word2442.216962414127
  Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs9467081.710475024
 Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body1359.5137504348827
 At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family57558.98521009719
 She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added,  "My eldest sister has been in town these three months11696758.022031795
 Have you never happened to see her there?"  She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet289115395778608.4
 The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away34561.711828222324
     CHAPTER VIII45.44094002286213
   Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings7066977.622006113
 It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening964524174008363.6
 For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter12613.485227815165
 Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr24562.314327221895
  The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room61449.80612193777
 Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room2542295236978.738
  Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs52561.963078050314
 Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much381.1940679214457
 He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr28056916377806.117
 Darcy19.074490057073533
 _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out,  "What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is253625938892293.06
  "Of music! Then pray speak aloud269.59511548713414
 It is of all subjects my delight366.34429508046986
 I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music33929.76855627126
 There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste227757.1728139063
 If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient112800.56140560852
 I am confident that she would have performed delightfully2254.4675726670844
 How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"  Mr869.5245641159805
 Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency554.0789536280068
"  "I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice973849.9654200681
 She practises very constantly122.19452900772332
 It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account6208173.160203957
 I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice16751.915822640225
 I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs641733.2735739616
 Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in Mrs39627761.07052057
 She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house177107.36140182804
  When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument2559356.5689768107
 He drew a chair near her214.30402063185173
 Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance6162168218.819991
 Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well946776.7582105212
 There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others8700.79924250069
 My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me437.9513706664552
"  Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say1998356185.9276817
 I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit114068241.6656859
 Indeed, Mr106.65117410519473
 Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear427434071.42472225
"  "I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly30419.541803869553
 "I should like to know how he behaves among strangers3625.842123260109
 The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances! I am sorry to pain you--but so it was1436476110.5519254
 He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner1293104.3502877743
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy, you cannot deny the fact551.9985730994036
"  "I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party133697.04310657032
"  "True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room1442.1691296364356
 Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders6831.058434823081
"  "Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers117028783.84763435
"  "Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam113917.1401693844
 "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"  "I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to him47640542108.886185
 It is because he will not give himself the trouble1138.910237824537
"  "I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before3499714.126289819
 I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done39294.49769503933
"  "My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do334846.8277397342
 They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression8520.5521252414
 It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution213745.8733770555
"  Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right13529.864677818066
 You have employed your time much better274.55479087104817
 No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting3603.2226403231866
 We neither of us perform to strangers244.69486106912828
"  Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of129494.26903289571
 Elizabeth immediately began playing again145.62588424638332
 Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy,  "Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master42199826775.97585
 She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's17862.6676102156
 Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn23155.8789908505
"  Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation1449578330447287.8
  Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste1478.9790045021375
 Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home17322667.532201696
   Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs27881.155396274073
 Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor1053634.720981015
 Darcy, and Mr122.81638247677924
 Darcy only, entered the room300.84153806574466
  He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within353248.48846492474
  They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence83340.89272587968
 It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,  "How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr7254832994313.279
 Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before691274.86659517
 He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London185867.71362780474
"  "Perfectly so--I thank you135.9118776836215
"  She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added,  "I think I have understood that Mr46319819.35715299
 Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"  "I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future610122670.2021698
 He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing78105.12240493795
"  "If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there82529859.91756512
 But perhaps Mr100.96335006857521
"  "I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers203607666.53988105
"  Elizabeth made no answer72.68591407905532
 She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him219601319.19622633
  He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house23952.690776382147
 Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr26244.889492702896
"  "I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object205032.87258373902
"  "Mr27.541780616983342
 Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife466.1443876974148
"  "Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had18068657.800626207
 My friend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr14169.229528983018
 Collins as the wisest thing she ever did300.5182320291498
 She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her2171307.4642147794
"  "It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends2012371.4946515826
"  "An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles3013.53061591724
"  "And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey5650.83147514004
"  "I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match," cried Elizabeth682923.7692267926
 Collins was settled _near_ her family305.80225359881496
"  "It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire3472.848376242829
"  As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,  "I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family23645213359663.477
 The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances1632.2348488572432
 Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil3904.658559472875
 Mr7.838204499203478
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance3294907.9007185255
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment5413640.013498858
 _You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn1360.5892324392662
"  Elizabeth looked surprised107.08753631559881
 The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,  "Are you pleased with Kent?"  A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk222473909265444.84
 The tête-à-tête surprised them134.18233233100995
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away9397828.104900923
  "What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone443756.10165210976
 "My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way2312567.9083748832
"  But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year3636083617002.5684
 All field sports were over154.05301389984075
 They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt88732.19883756386
 It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind1.541714733657891e+17
  But why Mr101.94262299313932
 Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand24840.184707157117
 It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself533965785.8043142
 He seldom appeared really animated134.36679224298737
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Collins knew not what to make of him637.861100544192
 Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out35943693062938.484
--She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success98421.96653066504
 He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable194944.9952803561
 It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind1601831.9448777304
 Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power224437521711.96017
 He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr3248552.666187671
 Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all13993.357436008318
     CHAPTER X45.44094002286213
   More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr6173.393699744816
 Darcy19.074490057073533
--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers151851907.42651528
--How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third30379.773592410544
 It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her87690952.75325732
 He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr88459585797.69489
 Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too36367144.467397146
 His words seemed to imply it202.559309188515
 Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter1602980.2881774
 It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage920629.1174769131
  She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr24374401.304826375
 Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her3933.021205050373
 Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,  "I did not know before that you ever walked this way2339914.615138527
"  And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together10541.64766837655
  "Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she4707.750848654212
  "Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again534.2136948495764
 He arranges the business just as he pleases402.0962808928416
"  "And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice522280.80034952913
 I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr29350.540477605402
"  "He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam65199.653623402985
 "But so we all do289.9600768015159
 A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence11973.765962080935
"  "In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either15128.827675950883
 Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"  "These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature2298538668.762271
 Younger sons cannot marry where they like305.89992126311716
"  "Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do15498.945676273297
"  "Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money217211.17898066863
"  "Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds10561761552257.777
 To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,  "I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal67554654.71231903
 But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her6008128.857331687
"  "No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me1096307.1515458727
 I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy5271.728167546361
"  "Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way650210800.591214
"  As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth9527700599.972307
 She directly replied,  "You need not be frightened16792.029836065678
 I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world6198729.573057531
"  "I know them a little439.2386146328873
 Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of Darcy's4989.149754469469
"  "Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr4866.212952243489
 Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr162.4519741397238
 From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him194140.3810244643
 But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant1619015.3309749984
 It was all conjecture236.10793703316864
"  "What is it you mean?"  "It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing5914585473.791025
"  "You may depend upon my not mentioning it502.933582392151
"  "And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley59866.82034899375
 What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer81881419129964.94
"  "Did Mr98.15548984499618
"  "And what arts did he use to separate them?"  "He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling42455709.28356849
 "He only told me, what I have now told you11842.58512385428
"  Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation4031.9645947697895
  "I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she83372.49928949225
 "Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings354.98755305261227
 Why was he to be the judge?"  "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"  "I do not see what right Mr50863926.028647155
 Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy33735429.81792401
" "But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him9512200.243129514
"  "That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly2595395.0337159797
"  This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr9187.371205034075
 Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage53400683.91662441
 There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard49270448.1197849
 It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected13412.754784161625
 That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr8029.0482449960655
 Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them3053530.996822108
 If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer450250516.1869686
 He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted3133829.440025169
  "There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London3245158.5120005687
 All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating60010.17944459374
 Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr104835.4288190119
 Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach1222.1046085601524
" When she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr15421013.696178555
 Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr674678622141.7543
 Bingley for his sister203.24809388648578
  The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr263208.14076547936
 Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea33592.41618017092
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr12818097.090290217
 Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home5742.3895063479395
     CHAPTER XI56.24636485292475
   When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr316493.7013569084
 Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent84216.27925774199
 They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering9635.215487935246
 But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded157403662398.78043
 Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal76518.32966745668
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings329404.08631253475
 It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do79434299563.67018
  She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him345198340351.0297
  While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her111913667873.9268
 But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr867430.2775080806
 Darcy walk into the room174.9300468375034
 In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better90881.37598772078
 She answered him with cold civility251.70194508750146
 He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room41246.50461115246
 Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word958.4490758272241
 After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began,  "In vain have I struggled262970.84508339845
 It will not do484.8736360932794
 My feelings will not be repressed930.820148100379
 You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you5087.6963174340335
"  Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression251.09053234342446
 She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent1486.0500449703154
 This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed3878480.5668183416
 He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride34782673.57817541
 His sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit4061672.4918818567
  In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger3259175729286.4478
 She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done259270.22057155418
 He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand4922036905.703947
 As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer459662.52253205836
 Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,  "In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned3061896982019.223
 It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you330465.7627664713
 But I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly22188.604818659624
 It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration403660.2523144989
 Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise380759.16049354617
 His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature29694.675622182942
 He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it252565.54955227638
 At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,  "And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected4477395668787.649
 But it is of small importance1002.6619763707986
"  "I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have other provocations2211158566172.115
 You know I have176.14122717697938
 Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"  As she pronounced these words, Mr2733332964965.7007
 Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued86366.24891484067
  "I have every reason in the world to think ill of you14710.78300077143
 No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_997.7333165902069
 You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind72023913071.1732
"  She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse262005.76522571567
  "Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated34547.08921336116
  With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success710098243.9308717
 Towards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself6257.706457789376
"  Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her77474.3835472125
  "But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded161537.2783887278
 Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided4525.231907355127
 Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr1676.6930466787417
 Wickham34.031571574818216
 On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"  "You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour705139058814.9952
  "Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"  "His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed55248955.765612334
"  "And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy4772.8811398562675
 "You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty1421.1750269648257
 You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him20398.268087105025
 You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule17217.838707809275
"  "And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully13402829360.28735
 My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design4996141568.906993
 These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing5552337.962891667
 But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence283.1224875557102
 Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related670.7214799543796
 They were natural and just172.38090786349088
 Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections? To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"  Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,  "You are mistaken, Mr145560253485.048
 Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner49457384.03728515
"  She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,  "You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it12244810159.86152
"  Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification89079.57188066746
 She went on179.66467678077947
  "From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry6.372280600036891e+17
"  "You have said quite enough, madam504.11761319369253
 Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness126271.19000714962
  The tumult of her mind was now painfully great1800.2365901255007
 She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour64307.645527973
 Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it39268.24978822309
 That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr1689.1098135625155
 Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection2833116472622212.0
 But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr20247543351.37781
 Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited610718.4207963133
  She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room798248.5919849831
     CHAPTER XII45.44094002286213
   Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes14051.038794230715
 She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise581975208.5624071
 She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr8277.240635102837
 Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road1117364.082762797
 The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground748637.6879057101
  After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park92121927.53723742
 The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees18365733.38353462
 She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr57148968.24499222
 Darcy, she was directly retreating998.8399073861975
 She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr241675.7039782478
 Darcy, she moved again towards the gate331.9424065281708
 He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you1373644091.3746545
 Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight6985538.915343702
  With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand205523908.97016555
--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it2097.208115089253
 It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--       "Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,      or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to      you126503976647.30019
 I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling      myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,      cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,      and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been      spared, had not my character required it to be written and read91409580813789.48
       "Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal      magnitude, you last night laid to my charge283778.7360642346
 The first mentioned      was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached      Mr50487.62084761568
      Wickham34.031571574818216
--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of      my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who      had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who      had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,      to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could      be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison11024299777819.95
--But      from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally      bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in      future secured, when the following account of my actions and their      motives has been read67094999.64647939
--If, in the explanation of them which is      due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which      may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry1502855391.726224
--The      necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd479.8687792433824
--I      had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with      others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other      young woman in the country126794892.6783148
--But it was not till the evening of the      dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a      serious attachment1193762.1522818354
--At that      ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made      acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that      Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general      expectation of their marriage267687458.57795683
 From that moment I      observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then      perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had      ever witnessed in him2529507.6182191325
 Your sister I also watched233.12935650468592
--Her look and      manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any      symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the      evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with      pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of      sentiment948056996.1868382
--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have      been in an error1282303.1910188773
 Your superior knowledge of your sister must make      the latter probable1429.7231571415566
--If it be so, if I have been misled by such      error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been      unreasonable3656151.598730082
 But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity      of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given      the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her      temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched3330310187.963124
--That I was      desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will      venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually      influenced by my hopes or fears57879.0405005716
--I did not believe her to be      indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial      conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason330080.12472023006
--My objections to      the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged      to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my      own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to      my friend as to me1198080470.4279356
--But there were other causes of      repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to      an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to      forget, because they were not immediately before me8365971.401605821
--These causes      must be stated, though briefly331.44654397891134
--Pardon me112.89791176757475
--It pains me to offend you189.37510259130406
 But amidst      your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your      displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you      consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to      avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally      bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to      the sense and disposition of both63406852366.44577
--I will only say farther, that      from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was      confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me      before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy      connection137840887.65637106
--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon      returning27197406.434341885
--The part which I acted, is now to be explained2067.528267001078
--His      sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our      coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible      that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly      resolved on joining him directly in London32826188.05140471
--We accordingly      went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to      my friend, the certain evils of such a choice128021.1398050327
--I described, and      enforced them earnestly233.68967987135855
--But Bingley has      great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment      than on his own35968.002178065515
--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived      himself, was no very difficult point256883.91680421415
--I cannot blame myself for      having done thus much458.2468086952654
 There is but one part of my conduct in the      whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is      that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to      conceal from him your sister's being in town641992856.5123103
 I knew it myself, as      it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant      of it588756.6359961254
--That they might have met without ill consequence, is      perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough      extinguished for him to see her without some danger569126.4139529833
--Perhaps this      concealment, this disguise, was beneath me497.2785016446673
--It is done, however,      and it was done for the best67278.32627589874
--On this subject I have nothing more      to say, no other apology to offer106347.34193317273
 If I have wounded your sister's      feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which      governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have      not yet learnt to condemn them130401523.65252623
--With respect to that other, more      weighty accusation, of having injured Mr2054.6712071273714
 Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but      of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one      witness of undoubted veracity8808422.325654393
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Wickham is the son of a very      respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the      Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his      trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on      George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore      liberally bestowed18094118922529.38
 My father supported him at school, and      afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own      father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have      been unable to give him a gentleman's education101445388.3681705
 My father was not      only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always      engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the      church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it490826113.24040264
      As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think      of him in a very different manner4232220.218689728
 The vicious propensities--the      want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge      of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man      of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of      seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr2461149946.2594037
      Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell1711.7019795802846
      But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr722.6292859260589
 Wickham has created, a      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his      real character3364.6357916327997
 It adds even another motive130.5291913236707
 My excellent father      died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr3129.7601070262135
 Wickham was to      the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it      to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his      profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a      valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became      vacant27753497809.221043
 He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,      and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would      be a very insufficient support therein13778446.61969402
 I rather wished, than      believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to      accede to his proposal181414.83348021217
 I knew that Mr165.42869100155818
 Wickham ought not to be a      clergyman3492.9529714669407
 The business was therefore soon settled243.12992574378518
 He resigned all      claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could      ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three      thousand pounds9274715.917431679
 All connection between us seemed now dissolved226.3524531204957
 I      thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his      society in town52580.06683957652
 For      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the      incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied      to me again by letter for the presentation89510184.14244613
 His circumstances, he      assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were      exceedingly bad271263.5672326041
 He had found the law a most unprofitable study,      and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would      present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there      could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other      person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered      father's intentions92460089336967.92
 You will hardly blame me for refusing to      comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it8261.906318391266
      His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his      circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me      to others, as in his reproaches to myself82067.036694497
 After this period, every      appearance of acquaintance was dropt503.21139070348187
 How he lived I know not589.6222843769112
 But      last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice610.4424825216444
 I      must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget      myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce      me to unfold to any human being490555.62166981335
 My sister, who is more than ten years my      junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel      Fitzwilliam, and myself1176268.8740510049
 About a year ago, she was taken from      school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last      summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;      and thither also went Mr62802537.469530225
 Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there      proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs18096.349757422755
      Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by      her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,      whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his      kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe      herself in love, and to consent to an elopement57172133546.62896
 I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the      intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea      of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as      a father, acknowledged the whole to me37833064.632533215
 You may imagine what I felt      and how I acted1507.9950103059616
 Regard for my sister's credit and feelings      prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr6573.698640086335
 Wickham, who left      the place immediately, and Mrs1323.4488651362585
 Younge was of course removed from      her charge959.2942562081993
 Mr7.838204499203478
 His revenge would have been complete indeed1118.1804811245283
      This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we      have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject      it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty      towards Mr2941948447.495552
 Wickham34.031571574818216
 I know not in what manner, under what form of      falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to      be wondered at606393.6063363602
 Ignorant as you previously were of every thing      concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and      suspicion certainly not in your inclination539242.292966207
 You may possibly      wonder why all this was not told you last night6004.079580377612
      For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more      particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our      near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of      the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted      with every particular of these transactions3262401804.9889216
 If your abhorrence of      _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented      by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may      be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find      some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course      of the morning4054862600938.8374
 I will only add, God bless you308.94896504855285
       "FITZWILLIAM DARCY109.00949546621302
"     CHAPTER XIII59.279486696303046
   If Elizabeth, when Mr289.47078718999995
 Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents9428628.84563645
 But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited2762145.234849058
 Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined1202.2545337156687
 With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal71053612.07964355
 With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield84811.19878214113
 His belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice718113453.8004749
 He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty31460.440331403603
  But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr1181.9882134991499
 Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition1681068225.0782669
 Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her1370.4404498921808
 She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again31678698671701.48
  In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence20375984811002.934
 The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr819346.9214720762
 Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words48343.40682443526
 So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great30722.352439232665
 What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err712311013824.8925
 But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate37385281.19049974
 She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success108986.84135548554
 Again she read on177.60240378214712
 But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr632422.8713413309
 Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole26946.24647015261
  The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr713.6089455894886
 Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice44576.43813543033
 She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance6125307735.551637
 Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself12392.359261561991
 As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring3096925.168003864
 His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue14319.068363886028
 She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr19648.806743431665
 Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr335660.0093592578
 Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance551.5487383076263
 But no such recollection befriended her171.79370870517312
 She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess4332479277.351882
 But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question5365219142864.379
 At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr61717180.68202628
 Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration93705.86803362906
  She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr59303.2230310447
 Philips's80.22429426358612
 Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory694.985888450279
 She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before88011.75021652722
 She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct738341.9555512872
 She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr3696.7806547865052
 Darcy--that Mr81.23161774693521
 Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week1233643.809844626
 She remembered also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr8176443673.655191
 Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son63152.16772614917
  How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing1083357002.8075216
 Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr6085.305931533046
 Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits35182018907464.26
 That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling152968913.99173522
 That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr1099842882.0813253
 Bingley, was incomprehensible129.92507630771044
  She grew absolutely ashamed of herself201.0361732592574
--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd74433.65450154335
  "How despicably have I acted!" she cried763.8950840076654
--"I, who have prided myself on my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust12124471.290860012
--How humiliating is this discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind416740.00850939483
 But vanity, not love, has been my folly1757.0315645408532
--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned390616802.58371675
 Till this moment, I never knew myself1608.0968798019062
"  From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr37089.55897074138
 Darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again66895.94287826869
 Widely different was the effect of a second perusal984.7744528974785
--How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been3443541194.548479
--Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane1733.8256302074512
--She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility16206924.986412743
 The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers17469574982.67205
 It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before513988259169.0394
  After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation978351557732081.4
  She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr32442.273185154507
 Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found1307656037.3718839
--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it2673.0226097627205
 Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object896.9594907881065
 She could think only of her letter503.8486789550542
     CHAPTER XIV56.24636485292475
   The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr3037.7486874168235
 Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings1240852947.5514338
 To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her347530217298.6805
  Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been109197973959.90407
 "What would she have said?--how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself6026.660335624936
--"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do709366779.9856817
 But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are1168773.7272654034
 The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year38219.61914249507
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter97925.51850184517
  Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,  "But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer182292799227780.6
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure9443.79330737515
"  "I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it22569718.383955847
--I must be in town next Saturday1936.718549553517
"  "Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks13759.978394977878
 I told Mrs98.24698044095993
 There can be no occasion for your going so soon1390.7258633291863
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight273.7150713970726
--He wrote last week to hurry my return304.55510743180866
"  "Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can2427.3206100007706
 And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large9.312659581792116e+17
"  "You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan42325.80511377047
"  Lady Catherine seemed resigned176.79489934598496
  "Mrs21.994241784043503
 Collins, you must send a servant with them1852.4443113589832
 I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing8889.752990944777
--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life7186.558417010473
 When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her36772.915737325944
--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr1680.2603609912435
--I am excessively attentive to all those things345.36095402638193
 You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs1563.721881749887
 Collins34.01810605666633
 I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone814015.3094552725
"  "My uncle is to send a servant for us1524.9213096901758
"  "Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things2790.0693482143934
--If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to24875.347101262043
"  Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was28277876761.2007
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart28069.870330365677
 She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different3302.491080062553
 When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion478800444.8447754
 His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again38322801.621374875
 In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin4371094.067471984
 Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing20962066241.62739
 They were ignorant, idle, and vain393.7722767189412
  Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr1476.9961659328906
 Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost24082.14169158858
 His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend564345.7447341598
 The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh27253935376687.938
  When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both1405391743.6889794
     CHAPTER XV45.44094002286213
 Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary598101.313964115
  "I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs198990.59002412646
 Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it13683010.496853106
 The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you2915.754236891004
 We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode2144.463609754112
 Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly3088109458967.6924
"  Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness657.3726955665954
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,  "It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably13575335.242328268
 We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome300583633.2694153
 Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast13377.13291091161
 You see on what a footing we are382.38896590849083
 You see how continually we are engaged there495.55660808047656
 In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings42418207.955139175
"  Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences41141151.3229135
  "You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin140547.57874858647
 I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so95705.42385578719
 Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs196.48682260619293
 Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage2618992.653505446
"  Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts5240059.446470344
 She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung985222.3382345157
 Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion206137800.75984395
 Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms256653.9731704496
  At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready52409.35553136478
 After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr8023.742962781063
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Gardiner, though unknown128.82865872961452
 He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings2923012730.5642476
  "But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here362155490.02514845
"  Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off26422.51911523135
  "Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!"  "A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh42897155908.07825
  "We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!--How much I shall have to tell!"  Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal72679349.33056024
"  Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr88803.44989814043
 Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days12138.014945354369
  Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them961551.151696118
 Darcy's proposals91.9311580326486
 To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther4.2728269718293814e+21
     CHAPTER XVI56.24636485292475
   It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr6567632497.462727
 Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs128356.78717813586
 These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber100841.95875706513
  After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?"  "And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there13328530382406.758
" Then shewing her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet6610.481015810232
 I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not1388395.8974995266
 I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better254218.60307713842
"  And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable104123737893.45389
 Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight31093593.416579798
 Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton6051868.634850108
 Lydia laughed, and said,  "Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion39520.21193937392
 You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say609215.3538193321
 I never saw such a long chin in my life1904.300274677834
 Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it? There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King3890529.677586076
 Wickham is safe116.10588382276646
"  "And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune14667.084417676786
"  "But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane118713.48626330982
 Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?"  Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!  As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it6.453250127749013e+16
  "How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia1203.095096578888
 "I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home14206513.701586416
 And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away152088.79387396935
 Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back2779418.755731084
 Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare1411.610557473576
 She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr457.40685699003006
 Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it218819.60501450507
 Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls6189891.847090825
 Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's12307.511814933618
 Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs3443.4959192170686
 Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs44133.065449194095
 Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col1076095665159.4268
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least3991835233865.2227
 Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs943.9395777467219
 Forster80.76730196628694
 I thought I should have died524.2190819785862
 And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter224445.17802482328
"  With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn355561.346565613
 Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name178826.6473176156
  Their reception at home was most kind363.2441987004034
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr5562.417492681818
 Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,  "I am glad you are come back, Lizzy119757.9326751496
"  Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs90258787.80124079
 Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her157929488941014.44
  "Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too2.626925188817204e+21
 And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach33292.03505840544
 I was ready to die of laughter439.709325248246
 And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"  To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures1643934027.5923975
 They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds465.1180969148602
 But I confess they would have no charms for _me_2340.73679857388
 I should infinitely prefer a book194.85671952815983
"  But of this answer Lydia heard not a word810.8265916560676
 She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all72878.43832254066
  In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme3448874.827215376
 It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers161043636.18529484
 There was another reason too for her opposition406.987963656218
 She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible54222.65687585783
 The comfort to _her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression27813.683490341795
  She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents70899832.72268231
 Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last1054006527.1146646
     CHAPTER XVII83.2924110012769
   Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr35386322697.21516
 She was sorry that Mr147.89528042399692
 Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him498304.2174707261
  "His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment5745899.895447253
"  "Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me41390074.112255044
 You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"  "Blame you! Oh, no1604775.426653221
"  "But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham2096.8568517140056
"  "No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did24815.036020845746
"  "But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day487348.28982827003
 What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual2790106.6989560947
 Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery16489.652714165746
 Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other16988.035774710068
  "This will not do," said Elizabeth3973.471443202251
 Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one26725.749500249287
 There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much903670.7122336135
 For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr4648.714975662628
 Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse1746.92304532488
"  It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane40512.778719042064
  "I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she167257.5152729827
 "Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief1232.6753151344183
 And poor Mr92.28529356765371
 Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing1614191.3371326223
 I am sure you must feel it so1140.958350641236
"  "Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both30824.12971960012
 I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent69454.95461978973
 Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather106064.09755784523
"  "Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner103614.07424194625
 One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it44984.370251497094
 Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do7878.854090861483
"  "And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason137386.69907842253
 One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty52171.95377908174
"  "Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now1581192.2026498977
"  "Indeed I could not540.5850229239627
 I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy1801.6414132361645
 And with no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"  "How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr28946753061031.67
"  "Certainly81.90233628315475
 But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging32591.30709457734
 There is one point, on which I want your advice2867.255526594843
 I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character112527.98523180193
"  Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully46998.01913049533
 What is your own opinion?"  "That it ought not to be attempted368844.3459950139
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public933.2348967608257
 On the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr20521301496.213146
 Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light1808715.23474679
 I am not equal to it604.894622900293
 Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is62343.13578878859
 Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before202312.60071063385
 At present I will say nothing about it337.9726439461617
"  "You are quite right220.77270018060568
 He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character27766.631854204574
 We must not make him desperate365.61278909830696
"  The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation1205.703180699371
 She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either9361318.263962276
 But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure6526.442787938023
 She dared not relate the other half of Mr439.8366443439942
 Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend42441.94141282852
 The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"  She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits95649134.39906058
 Jane was not happy157.33470311714441
 She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley423.2517283225765
 Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity534089464047076.4
  "Well, Lizzy," said Mrs1004.1902131107419
 Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody125912224.55346361
 I told my sister Philips so the other day852.2368133247442
 But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London12800.302325115645
 Well, he is a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now8097700.764753731
 There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know67154891.47234887
"  "I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more5146.4918814170705
 Nobody wants him to come282.99587004833353
 Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it12509044.96708579
 Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done11516584.129195515
"  But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer15525.533946133508
  "Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last103144236.41603388
 And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say8292.657153822991
 If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough15192.685770328837
 There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say4366.634103754476
"  "No, nothing at all262.10006722946525
"  "A great deal of good management, depend upon it3544.7770206552423
 Yes, yes165.1174914642471
 Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead115839.54846505188
 They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens16020.591995452116
"  "It was a subject which they could not mention before me22133.498924997766
"  "No101.05896134014294
 It would have been strange if they had1317.1828025308087
"     CHAPTER XVIII84.71383942266296
 It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace797954.0031006266
 The dejection was almost universal164.94056518838272
 The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments22308.855661532863
 Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family2707533.095899046
  "Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe77958.20746438383
 "How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?"  Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago3471322.128200121
 I thought I should have broke my heart807.0094417836832
"  "I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia50414.50020803397
  "If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs996.3483222500454
 Bennet26.587121706548537
  "Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable3390.8043973328377
"  "And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good," added Kitty800571.7215210042
  Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house758.655077587497
 Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame9775.531820772856
 She felt anew the justice of Mr250.89786371771308
 Darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend29421.6799421891
  But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs4551.680373523281
 Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton11283.612914091143
 This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married18600.174285536305
 A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_9242073.800687617
 Forster, the delight of Mrs168.1064183219397
 Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described13980.26968874716
 Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish7067719.765689881
  "I cannot see why Mrs256.362099170167
 Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia," said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend22157930.047840804
 I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older261873.7707494479
"  In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned170478.91201993937
 As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go3532985271301.664
 She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs131134.12279447535
 He heard her attentively, and then said,  "Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances18332939248.245796
"  "If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair92672530687.26892
 Bennet26.587121706548537
 "What, has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down22281.019582561203
"  "Indeed you are mistaken324.2421059861767
 I have no such injuries to resent479.5150994045301
 It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining21295.603060192007
 Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character454490.6581316546
 Excuse me--for I must speak plainly302.20822446297393
 If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment63275213761.2352
 Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous394705.0776669907
 A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite34528292.41947359
 In this danger Kitty is also comprehended279.4450401041439
 She will follow wherever Lydia leads171.8029901547601
 Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"  Mr10514548088.933916
 Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly sisters13997965.904302768
 We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton5478.240923314883
 Let her go then206.4442171766031
 Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body7661537.662767391
 At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here25581.936719611607
 The officers will find women better worth their notice392.3391771642331
 At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life62065.16549192523
"  With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry767287.3583245223
 It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them39066.42114490263
 She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition417221.9569947262
  Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility176804.47563822597
 In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness1248.8056425925759
 She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers2112.369424836085
 She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown12107.36283509418
  Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same307250420.4195068
 Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself61741.60829577485
  But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home201744.54358353355
  Elizabeth was now to see Mr319.5242402192297
 Wickham for the last time477.6565301269924
 Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so23852.128104102663
 She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary46908.882292124035
 In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her1594782709.085426
 She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal70697136945.2437
  On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr1113058651988.8672
 Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former51147.86092594565
 Her answer was warmly in his favour529.2476225100197
 With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you say that he was at Rosings?"  "Nearly three weeks114730436.98462205
"  "And you saw him frequently?"  "Yes, almost every day21636.20698436309
"  "His manners are very different from his cousin's1986.355284696644
 But I think Mr171.27879154440646
 Darcy improves on acquaintance121.70083613142948
"  "Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her13502.573093434847
 "And pray may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style? for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials1324552550885.6382
"  "Oh, no!" said Elizabeth2011.0433143375897
"  While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning93433.11375809333
 There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,  "When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood117242345399.96185
"  Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,  "You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr7173327892.863423
 I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe50492218.526933126
 His fear of her, has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart51861928962.26506
"  Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head51937.77639945607
 She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him562399.6851615394
 The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again1201927771.3744142
  When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs830.4766953034992
 Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning13410.963579643421
 The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic2382.4232905487033
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard4822552083139.266
     CHAPTER XIX56.24636485292475
   Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort321670.9190171729
 Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her499025895.6034596
 Respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown17525.02557780337
 But Mr54.11591301435265
 Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice948886.2275630513
 To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement69138.23815924313
 This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given8081724.087227429
  Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband139721.58147301959
 She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible348132731093.9499
 But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife1514944569.2950044
  When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment57635.63087492259
 Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp136627996463747.66
 Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself841376581.6746732
 Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect30643511177.658417
  "But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for444909.69837882457
 Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain852.447319322131
 But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized144437.9501207349
 A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation85902.41161172326
"  When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short3937973.9506121515
 Those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs6722190340128766.0
 Forster called her, and they were going to the camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public11941274949.61808
  After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn33856.466949338836
 Everything wore a happier aspect149.19678048698626
 The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose168948.50280597128
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton4357140931124.3706
  The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs1129824.6498194383
 Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent431.989673985475
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire5.981305061784328e+17
 In that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs1530984.1330416782
 Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction241.42771876122504
 The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak2045948351.2079275
  Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough91309.69148013058
 But it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again69211.15454063224
  With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected6138.080585678728
 It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner31456.677525931897
 "But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me392511.75380326965
 But they did pass away, and Mr759.6466744805984
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn1257.0990337813146
 The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them54692030223.54979
 One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad103389.6279655207
  It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c8354396.127624583
 A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern1349.0465673800866
 To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs719.3046929491879
 It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it12123.143422174557
 In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs950.5052385327234
 Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again813.0615810118343
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation5697.496370187692
 "A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected3085.5485147939
"  Elizabeth was distressed118.70030737464162
 She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it1808686.2587332171
 She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains115197.0397138994
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Gardiner abused her stupidity111.23411192196046
 "If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful32543164.986544553
"  Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce396.4661305847644
 The possibility of meeting Mr272.50721264682437
 Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred904.6147384430528
 It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk7265950.963433829
 But against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered209476366.33747357
  Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer238411639.11847752
  To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go26368.55276905217

     CHAPTER I46.42458135002346
  The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground974.6488772760994
 They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent48664.06093062579
  Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view24619.79071577378
 They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound277380006.6263724
 It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance510934.8612405001
 Elizabeth was delighted120.7550619856605
 They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!  They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned131531416877.12611
 She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken321.73263224842293
 On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was741135673.5565373
  The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her153670.10050922574
 They followed her into the dining-parlour464.9606564861483
 It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up696.2163652510586
 Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect4185.633615405687
 Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight1189853076.829684
 As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen11650.417286351034
 The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings2557764514.124939
  "And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt152631320457.59036
--But no,"--recollecting herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them3822118.8385628015
"  This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret561.6080925706484
  She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it21614.788718106443
 At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs204019.64466022878
 Reynolds replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends5321865.4058232745
" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!  Her aunt now called her to look at a picture85653.6724248616
 She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr881.3335386930753
 Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle-piece410.95610107683086
 Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it1622.147369375263
 The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence147362281.95130503
--"He is now gone into the army," she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild5405675.941291932
"  Mrs21.994241784043503
 Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it38273.322155752685
  "And that," said Mrs848.7598448950971
 Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master--and very like him5259.636696094635
"  "I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs11956.748428362085
 Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face12096.795473185115
 But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not10038.804099993413
"  Mrs21.994241784043503
 Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master1515.1996767594767
  "Does that young lady know Mr265.6578411152854
"  "And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"  "Yes, very handsome751864.8574401294
 This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then34187.734920851726
 He was very fond of them695.206878697022
"  This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr176.80055431041555
 Wickham's being among them139.21745227748207
 Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old166767.4227187474
  "And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr17155.583639678232
 In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him13517.509835776378

 Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs1974.9627860569185
 Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister40512.285195272474
"  "Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate22368.601954369133
"  "If your master would marry, you might see more of him2160.1468614766545
"  "Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be253778.4592871588
 I do not know who is good enough for him1339.2198245636541
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Gardiner smiled87.06753794974888
 Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so82879323.1479682
"  "I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him," replied the other2816500.0400738292
 Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old15847172803.792448
"  This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas2629.5456807488717
 That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion66065.86323704464
 Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying,  "There are very few people of whom so much can be said90244638.57397498
 You are lucky in having such a master327.4374125735971
"  "Yes, Sir, I know I am5329.991082379937
 If I was to go through the world, I could not meet with a better188942.10172978835
 But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world22948951.971429158
"  Elizabeth almost stared at her181.06888253810592
--"Can this be Mr214.7288167023558
  "His father was an excellent man," said Mrs3220.8463107224234
 Gardiner28.97482899810657
  "Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor1035079.176917292
"  Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more3033.594449625057
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Reynolds could interest her on no other point322.08695094132935
 She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain526221.5246054131
 Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase470387204.655863
  "He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived2830805.7216781387
 There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name24715.36180740993
 Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it421135.9184300212
 To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men82104.24884892222
"  "In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth3473.178999977865
  "This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend41990648.764431216
"  "Perhaps we might be deceived297.58293216654914
"  On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley478022865228.80566
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room3203.393003124931
 "And this is always the way with him," she added45212.18786798539
--"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment33270.13884162436
 There is nothing he would not do for her2396.3737900628776
"  The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shewn55635.201166451494
 In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible2578692077.2794914
  In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger56674.916451274
 At last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr382.2527719243924
 Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her2629758.4169447576
 She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery13351.414195227539
 Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time30366.504268784553
  There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance2153382.2783651394
 Reynolds was of no trifling nature221.48388373123484
 What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression2.141071522578936e+19
  When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door21019091.645164542
  As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables10690769211.565159
  They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight2210198.3198626693
 Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush20382.36833680319
 He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility193997122.34157014
 Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr182216.46122915772
 Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it5827.405750769272
 Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life41539147560.21099
 Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts1288123011201.437
  At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave15843247.975984428
  The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence139024800.8672245
 She was overpowered by shame and vexation177.49013923380144
 Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage1.61386783200557e+18
 She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting1652.5908953350659
 What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it5309759.092743458
  They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene6.481742800619357e+16
 Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr36877.56021058296
 Darcy then was102.62463623727994
 She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him1773320413.4817638
 Perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was not like ease23930429.001407485
 Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure16292761.791183759
  At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself4994733.191127753
  They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream7379081879.304312
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk22491.336231409616
 They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it5655712679.993712
 Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs116382.48580275822
 Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible1020356.7619184277
 Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr298373218.560532
 Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little955890553.7604945
 The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met38522.041270466674
 Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them5557413.773762028
 For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path637631.9013247857
 This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them41526.01744466703
 With a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed6.712399189741795e+16
 Her colour changed, and she said no more2721.9665670065488
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends11669664.690719342
 This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself2414974023.408167
 "What will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion330404.6391902217
"  The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions291144769049.6743
 That he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr46789183.69964374
 Gardiner28.97482899810657
 It was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush182809.6970814625
 She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners11648001.209400848
  The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr4147.874308211318
 Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport2553497971.656639
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder12389.64052541634
 Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself22881.0860775849
 Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened1884346927.2358625
 My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this1052.576795270852
 It is impossible that he should still love me1527.2379572614955
 It originated in Mrs101.73389024338107
 Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's97787.69230638334
 She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country429891969208402.2
" He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling84066189.63844731
 "They will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr258084.86826329096
"  Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow696.2592538605419
 Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr1491.9501381596128
 Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged3673011.412346064
  "There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"  The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it56370324940950.46
 Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased14752.967705819667
 His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind147042.77433828887
 They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr78734.42607690717
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward25368.82319966123
 She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject5084.243189821831
 At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance376227.6149036719
 Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over5873.076083882735
 On Mr80.25173592945904
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness50583677.82990372
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house118404.49212379145
  The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected324081.8985568506
  "There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming1061361624.555359
 I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it383183.81551047316
"  "I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us6053.732265311603
 It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention291973.4885567159
 His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling609.0555867543762
"  "To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good2210247238.4973645
 But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?"  Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning281182104313.61865
  "But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle45396.4127240981
 "Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds10474084.195417332
"  Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing12932.346226641923
  "From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs6380.581097257582
 Gardiner, "I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham19978494.35309116
 He has not an ill-natured look399.8321891463819
 On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks5184.829962957179
 And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart267187.5508494931
 But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes3616058.7177828834
 But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue1012802.842399688
"  Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire2.074240861479271e+16
 In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on249679149.62069988
  Mrs9.810835553236354
  The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr27407028.499079973
 Darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister142481.05628564808
     CHAPTER II55.98749846980634
 Darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning96802823.34563865
 They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street318606076926.2179
 Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected44966.18115386026
 Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business711009765.318755
 Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece12763097.933538966
 While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing2166.603327908289
 She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her34115106.15106976
  She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse452230022.26338905
 Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy1407187054.9635222
 She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable1277.0552978399976
  Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful32580034.90525779
 She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle3754401.4277657806
 Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr13239.518049446213
 Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings1578.0233543597685
  They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room1032432751875.4094
 All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again68560869.04595235
 He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done2072100.5535966128
  To Mr82.70839375133129
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself637.9132966240596
 The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention5809.064060134585
 The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr305.20258591324864
 Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love24626439.856922593
 Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough10597.952054268375
  Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do3739.9524250753498
 She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour15986166131434.041
  In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner10608340.479216037
 Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister1657.987688933066
 On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared65943288217.96141
 He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months1043035209423676.9
 We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield16154.94365606138
"  Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn77337397.745757
 There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning5024206.453996616
  It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr7449.737927459768
 Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day1701053517570.66
 When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible5015397429580953.0
 Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings10913769601500.643
  Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr97632.40361552643
 Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr4397.106016540764
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country140255.9143477379
 Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed40866.329082470234
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head3225775.8877136735
 Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on119592285120.81407
  Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends26213561.26409178
 Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little2747049314946.257
 Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress102051024.07050633
  But she had no reason to fear Mr3213.972468263612
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication8896.511550313526
 It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr7955.183036094334
 Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her2562979.498906616
 They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry1218.907956810162
  Of Mr86.34848527583084
 Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find22356989.574236054
 They could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr158810400014.8903
 Darcy19.074490057073533
 There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected16255794428.531076
 They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town, where the family did not visit9857157.899533242
 It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor1257855.7849955428
  With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr6144275350745.434
 Darcy afterwards discharged99.43473016095837
  As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out1960611801918.4668
 She certainly did not hate him194.47545720972872
 No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called4135262.672125537
 The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced64359026974.172714
 But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked326227.91647282155
 It was gratitude104.57990533583957
--Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection34527657.608365625
 Such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined79504180324.00652
 She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses1597032633364817.2
  It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning1.0490211118755396e+18
 They were, therefore, to go1831.0377893148618
--Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply1058704.4644516576
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Gardiner left them soon after breakfast436.5725658346046
 The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon854503.5677775274
     CHAPTER III55.98749846980634
   Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed7900370486.501182
  On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer181556.11971877734
 Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn1603542.3539780811
  In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs36177.21851540489
 Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved16593211.127542157
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her10988.634924169955
  By Mrs84.06591161711778
 Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments40340013.030795865
 It was first broken by Mrs156.22230007619078
 Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs2252167.543135513
 Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on1750.7074643127976
 Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard10754369.308988249
  Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention948357239.6410385
 This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much228013893.56820068
 Her own thoughts were employing her210.74910836523182
 She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room3463.2645597988626
 She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine2023004.7015278286
 After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family1588330.7848808747
 She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more10076.482566707373
 Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post14111.064098464
 There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table73474506.34590743
  While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr17988.77626040733
 Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came128426264.32232119
  He had been some time with Mr885.4284517419203
 Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning790208837.7717353
 No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room840943303669.3414
 In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr162173552.15571657
 Darcy were by no means over702.6270280703046
 Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side24622921906.951283
 Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,  "Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to _your_ family539175777645.6746
"  In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone8716262321.53704
 While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes6752064.222845423
 Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps3297414630725506.5
 To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own1149424485.5877516
 He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend166416263.73086235
 Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress103870.82294843366
 But Georgiana would not join her187.74619288510792
 Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable368759292.9026597
 When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister9223253.808606075
  "How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr1135.218772619447
 Darcy," she cried; "I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter2097675.2223550333
 She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again30660.541406272027
"  However little Mr110.94551239600764
  "For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her1984997.072200669
 Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome49520.84021173533
 Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines2013.8685439765327
 Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them138570206.80111745
 They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable131313393.44187911
"  Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected2559893941.947533
 He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,  "I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_ a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit1.017010831344035e+16
' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time137476.74825668757
"  "Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_ was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance117502761362.3784
"  He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself37466321.91185329
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both216282.99450974874
 The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention64757.528663789075
 Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject3368.3660608521773
     CHAPTER IV74.13126018818161
   Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere57875619261235.336
 Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill9079.703475713673
  They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves1413532.1332025828
 The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago6198.850816329337
 The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence38919883.10662852
 It was to this effect:       "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of      a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming      you--be assured that we are all well48899147.58436276
 What I have to say relates to      poor Lydia1672.3820473487347
 An express came at twelve last night, just as we were      all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was      gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,      with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise858237495.9734279
 To Kitty, however, it does not      seem so wholly unexpected33837.64460442708
 I am very, very sorry400.19622165838547
 So imprudent a      match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that      his character has been misunderstood94734.99385833474
 Thoughtless and indiscreet I      can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)      marks nothing bad at heart41975.01051666761
 His choice is disinterested at least,      for he must know my father can give her nothing20659.362170778404
 Our poor mother      is sadly grieved289.2976568282216
 My father bears it better162.35127315095073
 They were off Saturday night about twelve, as      is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at      eight4640.99667460409
 The express was sent off directly220.19644369229266
 My dear Lizzy, they must      have passed within ten miles of us7545.883290066651
 Colonel Forster gives us reason      to expect him here soon604.3657154707391
 Lydia left a few lines for his wife,      informing her of their intention6409.0213545460065
 I must conclude, for I cannot be      long from my poor mother12761.434827005776
 I am afraid you will not be able to make      it out, but I hardly know what I have written18606578.971079595
"  Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first9088532073.086926
       "By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried      letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not      confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer      for being coherent72727982.69934094
 Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would      write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed18750692.68910691
      Imprudent as a marriage between Mr234.32810296915372
 Wickham and our poor Lydia      would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for      there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland6718700.353292361
      Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day      before, not many hours after the express16640.695466261637
 Though Lydia's short      letter to Mrs227.26509696331414
 gave them to understand that they were going to      Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief      that W36382.505736155785
 never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which      was repeated to Colonel F257164.30026144945
 intending to trace their route171.8703464971745
 He did trace them easily to      Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed      into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them      from Epsom29932.66797051918
 All that is known after this is, that they were seen      to continue the London road70539.80310719086
 came on into      Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at      the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such      people had been seen to pass through4928361.808436058
 With the kindest concern he      came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner      most creditable to his heart67578.57645866426
 I am sincerely grieved for him and      Mrs280.77544583751205
 F26.884187799000365
 but no one can throw any blame on them757.8254712150415
 Our distress, my      dear Lizzy, is very great7731.074453717419
 Many circumstances might make it      more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to      pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design      against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,      can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible12399538809.617699
 is not disposed to depend upon their      marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he      feared W118582.99257580018
 was not a man to be trusted1844.9701033242543
 My poor mother is really ill      and keeps her room687.9022258254467
 Could she exert herself it would be better, but      this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life      saw him so affected883873209.4129468
 I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared      something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock      is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so      selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient1041007929229.1663
 Adieu85.17184886870659
 I      take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,      but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging      you all to come here, as soon as possible2895306146.2046485
 I know my dear uncle and      aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have      still something more to ask of the former23916949.958764482
 My father is going to      London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her8390.798144594295
 What      he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress      will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest      way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again      to-morrow evening3011199137.8313823
 In such an exigence my uncle's advice and      assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately      comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness6187740.7763153855
"  "Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr63879754479.36289
 I must find Mr127.74694375537936
"  "Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr1635953292.971035
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Gardiner28.97482899810657
 You are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself456.12634499736924
"  Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them325138.26554246375
 Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly1674626.9321455562
  On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid260498310672.34412
 Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very ill18802.60422080933
"  "No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself20475.24921858302
 "There is nothing the matter with me774.6096468170381
 I am quite well250.91220064287916
 I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn9249.323840289318
"  She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word287087.84891831037
 Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence15459.068932294871
 At length, she spoke again378.9605509209355
 "I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news26393.90495897721
 It cannot be concealed from any one464.5953082589766
 My youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr1021.0834406112999
 She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever3363.537695239847
"  Darcy was fixed in astonishment204.85000001219302
 "When I consider," she added, in a yet more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew what he was107786132.72791514
 Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened8830987.069041759
"  "I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked17484.041051579872
 But is it certain, absolutely certain?"  "Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland70481701.76413535
"  "And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"  "My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour180890216456.42252
 But nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done8628.054224377305
 How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope1495692.491386986
 It is every way horrible!"  Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence1538.5346470085137
  "When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character4200.184526625897
--Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much534283.6964670663
 Wretched, wretched, mistake!"  Darcy made no answer871.6387285576812
 He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy796563.6340861748
 Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it443.20319984428954
 She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress32845.37415259924
 It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain831604588.1666002
  But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her4800.982732818262
 Lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern6.675433365725112e+20
 Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress29159.58731704689
--But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks30454.61812811999
 This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day50414.760099520514
"  "Oh, yes158.12123086115446
 Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy2425.5002494624805
 Say that urgent business calls us home immediately251.09744687848402
 Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible1328.7773659718705
--I know it cannot be long1688.3717516476981
"  He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away15634060.05213288
  As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination8855872161142.258
  If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty3804.549985562593
 But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment66076348978207.914
 Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business2470358.7992077116
 Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her16160.483342945103
 No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation28817.979817402327
 Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement2904.8120878234504
 While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible1369074856.5333533
 But now it was all too natural777.1495485528694
 For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey19479213199.2671
  She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body224917109.09333292
 Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion14693.032157264513
 Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object872.3707591960534
--Oh! how acutely did she now feel it963.6414159312703
  She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe3877507575013488.0
 Mr7.838204499203478
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy189696235.1730555
--Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr4720.995837920395
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Gardiner could not but be deeply affected373.15645200002285
 Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr151391.08825761225
 Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power644.83191878312
--Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled909875.5408106602
 They were to be off as soon as possible7350.034836836821
 "But what is to be done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs11935.115916086346
 Gardiner28.97482899810657
 "John told us Mr122.88183384330776
 Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so?"  "Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement16564912.70399805
 _That_ is all settled976.7733073007865
"  "That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare170214.6666311005
 "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"  But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour728523948.1505023
 Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure725005829997.5018
 An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr12675.77618985491
 Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn2821939345805.147
     CHAPTER V54.81308000413998
   "I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter567757526401.7283
 It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best753168285.6180973
 Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk2020570.640203574
"  "Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment64643.49910327588
  "Upon my word," said Mrs796.633516340491
 Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion6845.750866411596
 I cannot think so very ill of Wickham829.96010650469
 Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"  "Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest114804144.50232574
 But of every other neglect I can believe him capable905.7181010283405
 If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it212222.71648802896
 Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?"  "In the first place," replied Mr29924701.7226917
"  "Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road1322942.1811523824
"  "Well, then--supposing them to be in London2463.356147371734
 They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose5862.430125100704
 It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland36899321.74982395
"  "But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely1201620.303768048
 His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her33139.037390347235
 Wickham will never marry a woman without some money483.001238343873
 He cannot afford it130.3990692190301
 And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce20716896580710.824
 But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good38474.08837082895
 Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter14889419469839.36
"  "But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"  "It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt3376586939034848.0
 But, really, I know not what to say6411.114260833533
 Perhaps I am not doing her justice1309.8593354149018
 But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity90478746.2911672
 She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way2805092.751354172
 Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head1255059.9148912458
 She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough27191278.019200794
 And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman11389.502119382028
"  "But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt45278369.39021253
"  "Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is2716844046.0552096
 We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word8583.417416687555
 That he has neither integrity nor honour553.532537887533
 That he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating12224.364916169625
"  "And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs2933.4668449304995
 Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive5083.933538397948
  "I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring19726.872178895243
 "I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr13843.794005527905
 Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him12327333.692636328
 And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless5930070.962410088
 From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl466241.3600025857
 Yet he knew to the contrary himself399.563823715134
 He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her46922.68167042676
 Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr9852.468534291967
 Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself68810.97405066383
 And when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time157235.4711947244
 As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs11065032792665.533
 Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me13412.34279469477
 That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head6490.3370175417
 That such a consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts41245.0483307566
"  "When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other2087758.7717938558
"  "Not the slightest184.74374155833377
 I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away836708177.8006519
 When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were424827.62914359616
 Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites3855358354151.1143
"         *       *       *       *       *  It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey888655978.4996948
 From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent266.69660475895483
 Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness15822.952947808099
  They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day24949.10352878614
 It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations50312.707164615786
  The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome948191508143.2642
  Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her7838124.036743851
  Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives1264316.6289065597
  "Not yet," replied Jane1434.1315013719593
 "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well30673.895442309287
"  "Is my father in town?"  "Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word145336.3524373559
"  "And have you heard from him often?"  "We have heard only once120787.13377211241
 He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do184587096.80692905
 He merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention167358.11120997946
"  "And my mother--How is she? How are you all?"  "My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken3640570.149071355
 She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all8599.821824006845
 She does not yet leave her dressing-room649.140296929697
 Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven! are quite well954.6177820914005
"  "But you--How are you?" cried Elizabeth1441.1826518532396
 "You look pale177.67502231060647
 How much you must have gone through!"  Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr1154012191.457727
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party623946.4915489056
 Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears66142.72638119072
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing49446259712.483894
 Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after85445646156.6775
 I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am2381875.5421202676
 Poor dear child! And now here's Mr265.56788728373283
 Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do723754049581496.8
"  They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr364.84228776780185
 Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr629731222.0047141
  "Do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain35817086.19279984
 It is not quite a week since they left Brighton1766.96777116564
 In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost1994914011.4715164
 As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done3427780784.2382727
"  "Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs4723.635124465755
 Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for3353.062554247956
 And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry32143223.24627285
 And, above all things, keep Mr342.17315794486217
 Bennet from fighting94.49944428342918
 Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day1899534576.1073337
 And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses12017117.381081322
 Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all5653.463431631698
"  But Mr94.38824515843314
 Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters62148339306751.516
  Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject8577152532265945.0
  In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before5327347.278139625
 One came from her books, and the other from her toilette11686.367045320503
 The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty245460891459.94812
 As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,  "This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of647542499.0683963
 But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation18642.604866888007
"  Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex28943198618.768272
"  Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply33164.056538858866
 Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them37105.859898605675
  In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy73880639.87215176
 After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have not already heard1036249042432.4628
 Give me farther particulars184.24568012542315
 What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever511651.73642026196
 He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey68424790.24955118
"  "And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"  "Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it39841314224.42071
 He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before18256579.90534438
"  "And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"  "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right42406783381228.02
 My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be53529.77213019428
 She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks192334.0075081823
"  "But not before they went to Brighton?"  "No, I believe not154587.4679145893
"  "And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he know his real character?"  "I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did229919578.5154999
 He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant1147.8405488020005
 And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false15831314.183864443
"  "Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"  "Perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister1921867068.374016
 "But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable15261.10588513809
 We acted with the best intentions225.32497934204883
"  "Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?"  "He brought it with him for us to see2528946.4666957934
"  Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth2927.655546548451
 These were the contents:       "MY DEAR HARRIET,       "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help      laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am      missed3243082952.3759403
 I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with      who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the      world I love, and he is an angel1241160038.2886524
 I should never be happy without      him, so think it no harm to be off16394.402949195028
 You need not send them word at      Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the      surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia      Wickham1245631063.8669503
 What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for      laughing17775.9090841021
 Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my      engagement, and dancing with him to-night3243.0697484499583
 Tell him I hope he will      excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at      the next ball we meet, with great pleasure18990004.156343736
 I shall send for my      clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally      to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are      packed up7566973.201870978
 Good bye62.064654824518854
 Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you      will drink to our good journey23352.31032652879
       "Your affectionate friend,       "LYDIA BENNET825.2036256158262
 "What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment52875.21242782034
 But at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey77294.71483983225
 Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy186438.11011257354
 My poor father! how he must have felt it!"  "I never saw any one so shocked503139.1347504652
 He could not speak a word for full ten minutes2063.162769150054
 My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"  "Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"  "I do not know382804734576480.2
--I hope there was254.228969181102
--But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult10903.459211169686
 My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties199865379979.35147
 You do not look well299.2729133688628
 Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone156897.96912410023
"  "Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them100970015.52174886
 Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on123135.57429702001
 My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me552639.7942057647
"  "She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours66381913.767477535
 Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable234.75060663530238
"  She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter2239543.267622439
  "He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them109491945.73085874
 His principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham13246.865151711334
 It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham35522099.85071061
 If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach15656580.44246744
 I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this15291895619.97315
"     CHAPTER VI82.55313849101614
 Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him21759.600208755124
 His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion2271999.0093643446
 They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain36134795.89486367
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off1237.3553047373157
  When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr11525625.09479292
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 She shared in their attendance on Mrs200.49024017929034
 Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom95465.68260202816
 Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them392177753.95560765
  All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light105616.25722254351
 He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family7313979.985489442
 Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness307480121.2254219
 Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them2.1591089473614452e+16
  Mr7.838204499203478
 That Mr80.0739156478626
 Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr307195782.3975621
 Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings2133841.121918337
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it1807304.4787813984
 He added, that Mr570.2317288976767
 Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon49373.24958256286
 There was also a postscript to this effect480.1781557512899
  "I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself22148425276.665424
 At present we have nothing to guide us677.7720323250275
 Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head243906.2106901473
 But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person75555.80696143153
"  Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved115774896.89783818
  She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years236520.6280611227
 It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to629245256105.4585
  Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected175954.85707234335
 The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience2192.12963472021
 Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance9647556.945993697
  But before they heard again from Mr186.8227528094946
 Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr16958.61497185332
 Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise1000774038.0304638
 It was as follows:       "MY DEAR SIR,       "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation      in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now      suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter      from Hertfordshire6801374395.958936
 Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs3959.606249936498
 No      arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe      a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that      must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind670505.2723273309
 The death      of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this27856.521992046506
 Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own      disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of      such an enormity, at so early an age18380093.41260108
 Howsoever that may be, you      are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined      by Mrs420528.4668830022
 Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,      to whom I have related the affair61379.45919244442
 They agree with me in      apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be      injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady      Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves      with such a family102089157.55724154
 Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,      to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy      child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the      fruits of her own heinous offence254800740.93181607
 &c79.62702059944802
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send416450.89811182115
 It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living13613863.355002806
 There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him55864.03842017914
 He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable44045.66045042088
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror8262.48893523883
 "A gamester!" she cried420.0251643643693
 "This is wholly unexpected247.5797044196627
 I had not an idea of it816.1655745590333
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday3196706.8982920605
 Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit805580537.8320863
 When Mrs78.6754998971786
 Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before761803.4478739694
 "Sure he will not leave London before he has found them2731.9821000429097
 Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"  As Mrs565450.7066420958
 Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr100548391.1221519
 Bennet came from it150.53973125055887
 The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn98678.31471505728
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world141923.72692519045
 His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs154304.9129492933
 Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing47722.54458127621
 Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley3653.577582782521
  The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better1627331907737004.0
 It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two19192.607605578745
  When Mr39.67534213164871
 Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure18736.127071509345
  It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that18607490962.13554
 Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it370705.66577874933
"  "You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth17301.332553125754
  "You may well warn me against such an evil613.6969451052871
 Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame18253005.873494554
 I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression799.937570595935
 It will pass away soon enough215.92164524216702
"  "Do you suppose them to be in London?"  "Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"  "And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty4720526627.163287
  "She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration2721096.3662549453
"  Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind66583377.85746458
"  They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea54234.12667962905
"  "I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if _I_ should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia192322059.82718876
"  "_You_ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it131835744.0969172
 Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters8309.522706131766
 And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner1139543.1465060818
"  Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry4797.682895311235
 If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them483963.235140186
"     CHAPTER VII82.55313849101614
   Two days after Mr126.70357591793272
 Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask1.5936874457693768e+21
"  "What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town3812.9051684899014
"  "Dear madam," cried Mrs1309.7006188938776
 Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr4280.047776339084
 Gardiner? He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter26862.362517935795
"  Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech4387.724016170768
 They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said,  "If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse1345298256288.187
"  Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock107213268.50222851
  Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out,  "Oh, Papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?"  "Yes, I have had a letter from him by express3.1748592493986988e+16
"  "Well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?"  "What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it34613759676.30925
"  Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand263.2927702273703
  "Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is about3847918.42065425
"       "Gracechurch-street, Monday,       August 2327.19091034317677
       "MY DEAR BROTHER,       "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such      as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction18206961.379377108
 Soon after      you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what      part of London they were190547.80831395293
 The particulars, I reserve till we meet734.4271439676678
      It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them      both----"  "Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"       Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both4381519736362.6577
 They are not married,      nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are      willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on      your side, I hope it will not be long before they are21711992574.080273
 All that is      required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her      equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your      children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,      moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your      life, one hundred pounds per annum24865006647.541748
 These are conditions, which,      considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as      far as I thought myself privileged, for you4161979.617324772
 I shall send this by      express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer6539.345275441777
 You      will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr656.5185618711533
 The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to      say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are      discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune1293903362.2649097
      If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act      in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will      immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper      settlement65851401.74425113
 There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming      to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on      my diligence and care2463549.3771252846
 We have judged it best, that my      niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will      approve430087.5894678599
 She comes to us to-day178.82637674699626

 GARDINER28.97482899810657
 "Can it be possible that he will marry her?"  "Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister91662123.85666157
 "My dear father, I congratulate you813.4160885038821
"  "And have you answered the letter?" said Elizabeth2600.6444640545546
  "No; but it must be done soon8782.818869780473
 Consider how important every moment is, in such a case5463.304555210573
"  "Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself524161.5476086032
"  "I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done221744.8297172865
"  And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house75690.13528140936
  "And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with4344055.023936934
"  "Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little4662.73611002379
"  "And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!"  "Yes, yes, they must marry2766326.118532524
 There is nothing else to be done1075.7726283767233
 But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him79074844.89049794
"  "Money! my uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir?"  "I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am gone53705488217.79112
 His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself6589174.76846148
 A small sum could not do all this646.4664716343704
"  "No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds1138284.0105522133
 I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship208656.71377359607
"  "Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?"  Mr5817.89935455322
 Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house59851.68173794671
 Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room237445.5651039903
  "And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves2369404.3522376018
 "How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful14720.306477894841
 That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!"  "I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her38721905365845.875
 Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced3660489.290654057
 How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"  "If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr22861065866.723072
 Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own4675.991355767333
 Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge116987.87749924685
 By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!"  "We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy57090260504115.9
 His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking3302771.3845905024
 Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten4213808.458860892
"  "Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget2330518.0930658127
 It is useless to talk of it407.4232247179847
"  It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened51810.56830365671
 They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her26342831.365206197
"  "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"  "Take whatever you like, and get away70488.61835028419
"  Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together42653.81401933049
 Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs369.46680879660613
 Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all2590.378162853208
 After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud1998.2333402304291
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet could hardly contain herself160.89829479677232
 Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance18013.397320135442
 She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation95587.11011633556
 She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct3640.4327956451266
  "My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried: "This is delightful indeed!--She will be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage every thing13554969.663297536
 How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly1354251.9067240641
 Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her96577.71102040765
 Stay, stay, I will go myself2680.7111583106816
 Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill1109.1941592572189
 I will put on my things in a moment601.7092155377064
 My dear, dear Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!"  Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr7761982.69576341
 Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under195.2969080223268
  "For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure, to his kindness347864.6195178786
 We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr1813.9646389612305
 Wickham with money110.80097811299248
 Well! I am so happy1095.025750739883
 In a short time, I shall have a daughter married18560.444870627423
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Wickham! How well it sounds220.2917508384037
 And she was only sixteen last June1733.2633054539688
 My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me82170827.05751027
 We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately10344.946352971234
"  She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted1840429200.5741954
 One day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual7275582.778500611
 Other schemes too came into her head280.0718149988112
 And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs11412.559146729176
 Long55.62223037835014
 Kitty, run down and order the carriage427.0873438332171
 An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure14546.402552198697
 Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill26846.13981858333
 My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding31444305.16556102
"  Mrs21.994241784043503
 Hill began instantly to express her joy441.05174794235796
 Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom9388777.562161455
  Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful4362480.760651015
 She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained6703469635.639007
     CHAPTER VIII45.44094002286213
   Mr7.838204499203478
 Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him17044596163.029627
 He now wished it more than ever316.3009068043096
 Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her754257.816168823
 The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place1131695.4096309447
  He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could343951999483.2241
  When first Mr87.95049003260118
 Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son908339.6871799285
 This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for19686428.635644134
 Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs35800.520828474655
 Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would26679.388230454762
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income17432.736412877184
  Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs772.3425752734904
 Bennet and the children153.7362535982348
 But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents20850.875318805935
 This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr640695.099616905
 Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him1740.0843692704716
 In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him341161149.8165166
 He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement24961581.330376294
 He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum17344071568.91932
 When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence38557.205374554746
 His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution48400.16164712095
 He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any message to her670544.4857917341
  The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood12398.885559375218
 It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy618.8962711018344
 To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house2780572813.037039
 Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high1683037.3537113338
 No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph447.90767015465144
 The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants13473163862.963541
 She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance4560136.194822327
  "Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful292231082833.65497
"  Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained4586.859404483058
 But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs25206.003646240402
 Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding148370.53792567365
 Into _one_ house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance3599.0729698245796
 I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn6258.215598139931
"  A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr384.27055562132114
 Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs638.173630515037
 Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter29209.599401631527
 He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion30453.695152019824
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet could hardly comprehend it151.0824055732714
 That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible33298787.265790783
 She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place14635837.770621313
  Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr488007.1177015836
 Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot9870610.759076579
  She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means2630.1024401394675
 Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr63584.44812793102
 Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned669757.7415650279
  From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink32878.315199555305
 The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this2744192.073782626
 She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what69917.93688320178
 She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it70137.12416545882
 She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence42549.62903838536
 She was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet2832860.228472196
  What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex12967919141.765785
 But while he was mortal, there must be a triumph1647.6578403998294
 His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes22195.107011415013
 It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance26066221571.686245
  But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was755.892601009347
 An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family157695.3394151567
  How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine72060.4798163245
 But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture82008.95897376446

 And I think you will agree with me,      in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both      on his account and my niece's403426.0833998262
 It is Mr93.15012597445546
 Wickham's intention to go      into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still      some who are able and willing to assist him in the army1798370.1864826435
 He has the      promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in      the North56956.216676743854
 It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of      the kingdom42271.50685481839
 He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,      where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be      more prudent454718.2080716651
 I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of      our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the      various creditors of Mr350466.6658651645
 Wickham in and near Brighton, with      assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself6785.101722704085
 And      will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances      to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,      according to his information702243.9588500091
 He has given in all his debts; I hope      at least he has not deceived us18766.504033266683
 Haggerston has our directions, and      all will be completed in a week4677.304315805681
 They will then join his regiment,      unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from      Mrs79741.31820046349

 Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr41115.4251798819
 Gardiner could do104.7213353539586
 But Mrs54.60913655680727
 Bennet, was not so well pleased with it4136.486904905446
 Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites216048723868442.38
  "She is so fond of Mrs293.9855630710033
"  His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative3675100.8484723023
 But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished1311617603565207.0
 And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North35758962.52794849
 When Mr39.67534213164871
 Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn966762356.8322008
 Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes1962338784.473448
   Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself103523.39351881167
 The carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time15581668.811974678
 Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure84909904.4237469
 Smiles decked the face of Mrs243.01965341559415
 Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy100061.86873653112
 Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness240270029.7782121
 Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial20641.5883903349
 His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips3006.5770121523838
 The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him45020.202311154404
 She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there2311082636511.602
  Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all4105482311.553537
 Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man2092821.5243948519
 _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour299894.0029778479
  There was no want of discourse496.69256849351586
 The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies1648814072.4244623
 They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world18193.303011132797
  "Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time89901273.0397008
 Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was1110386865.5852633
 Jane was distressed111.82161819657307
 Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing5.032833565259973e+19
"  Elizabeth could bear it no longer246.10684358405157
 She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour1874186.5217690764
 She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman24101723172.516132
"  It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first1901806.4059993457
 Her ease and good spirits increased431.5033858671573
 She longed to see Mrs149.72183903309838
 Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs86779.00228585758
 Hill and the two housemaids343.8545272929256
  "Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me138450572694.64243
 I only hope they may have half my good luck687.9408895347163
 That is the place to get husbands634.7814582552251
 What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go5751.1525905692715
"  "Very true; and if I had my will, we should17180.828926381128
 But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off8152.779502885789
 Must it be so?"  "Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that93379.67260000909
 I shall like it of all things353.2504627359786
 You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us5014.264232650377
 We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all109668608.25547422
"  "I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother17397.473980324557
  "And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over26236593.274160437
"  "I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands23486592.96768296
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight1384807.1399233704
  No one but Mrs155.5493845527955
 These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not117648.84603052017
 She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion2.3046293381913367e+19
  Lydia was exceedingly fond of him250.48518981974325
 He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him34801.95444500956
  One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,  "Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe42302833563.28383
 You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it353614.79569196154
 Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"  "No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject139967384.27932462
"  "La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off36019.09004277467
 We were married, you know, at St3488.9418408869583
 Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish455.71393738860655
 And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock4906.69095575887
 My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church3910664.6157376287
 Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted5489207579.767486
 And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon193085.31591682945
 I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat4251.02475007365
  "Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them30997143823.90456
 If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight493779.02022280067
 Not one party, or scheme, or any thing1932.0579980176674
 Stone84.07894860263816
 Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day16576457888.304533
 But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out126579.96687249499
 However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr704663.9947852129
 Darcy might have done as well352.64199562892685
"  "Mr27.541780616983342
  "Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know16354.591342331247
 But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it10407.900212891627
 I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"  "If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the subject15171113148.151487
 You may depend upon my seeking no further371.2824340209972
"  "Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions156934.49378186645
"  "Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry253135893.37095994
"  On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away111838.21350771937
  But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information232508.56590639357
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy had been at her sister's wedding625.0471090138486
 It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go83084.18373209222
 Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none3383914.160925971
 Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable9120.583236952642
 She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended75790119.70830774
  "You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time3066842077.0336814
 Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance36380690.6520159
"  "Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out1656353602428.808
"  Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante32293121.08991349
     CHAPTER X45.44094002286213
   Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could45382.88378441844
 She was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial1657130117947.543
       "Gracechurch-street, Sept150.43417788016882
 644.21003976148665
       "MY DEAR NIECE,       "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole      morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will      not comprise what I have to tell you1082725239.7091787
      Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,      that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_      side72209265.83374771
 If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my      impertinence2338.5870010488693
 Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing      but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed      him to act as he has done1185456.3325794626
 But if you are really innocent and      ignorant, I must be more explicit16994.10706421928
 On the very day of my coming      home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor45659.39786677614
 Mr7.838204499203478
      Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours7184.959565088977
 He came to tell Mr338.0776099749745
 Gardiner that      he had found out where your sister and Mr4531.724938852163
 Wickham were, and that      he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia      once221288.13916991866
 From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day      after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting      for them88650.76351623937
 The motive professed, was his conviction of its being      owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well      known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,      to love or confide in him316764660.07979304
 He generously imputed the whole to his      mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath      him, to lay his private actions open to the world1208365.6046017283
 His character      was to speak for itself423.1460976652152
 He called it, therefore, his duty to step      forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on      by himself928973.7203286961
 If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never      disgrace him50733.15301362344
 He had been some days in town, before he was able to      discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was      more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another      reason for his resolving to follow us503627871498.8636
 There is a lady, it seems, a      Mrs1378.8346855837858
 Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was      dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though      he did not say what296808396.9849182
 She then took a large house in Edward-street,      and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings3508.513515640415
 This Mrs82.607631552453
      Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he      went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town30192918.747549675
 She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery      and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be      found1875385.6200785723
 Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in      London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they      would have taken up their abode with her1068100106.9177492
 At length, however, our      kind friend procured the wished-for direction1435.8052233579738
 They were in ----      street2635.3657918840095
 He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia2324.996388931069
      His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade      her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,      offering his assistance, as far as it would go94967843093.52599
 But he found Lydia      absolutely resolved on remaining where she was817.5668914102923
 She cared for none      of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of      leaving Wickham531153.0045524037
 She was sure they should be married some time or      other, and it did not much signify when708703.8925245333
 Since such were her      feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a      marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he      easily learnt, had never been _his_ design518918632.62504816
 He confessed himself      obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,      which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the      ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone10386338.985173155
 He      meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future      situation, he could conjecture very little about it231289.75783643444
 He must go      somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have      nothing to live on16067173.158453664
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy asked him why he had not married your      sister at once2771.3136822605943
 Though Mr87.20286015231045
 Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,      he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation      must have been benefited by marriage654245839.5274
 But he found, in reply to      this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more      effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country504702.6141282302
      Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof      against the temptation of immediate relief537118.3894351746
 They met several times,      for there was much to be discussed4640.233083624088
 Wickham of course wanted more      than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable21638.121178262503
      Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr1011.159283407886
 But Mr54.11591301435265
 Gardiner      could not be seen, and Mr2608.679920981076
 Darcy found, on further enquiry, that      your father was still with him, but would quit town the next      morning452719.57956732187
 He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could      so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed      seeing him, till after the departure of the former8502763.629398532
 He did not      leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a      gentleman had called on business4301208.140509127
 On Saturday he came again209.64634095562687
 Your      father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they      had a great deal of talk together49387902.1782835
 They met again on Sunday, and      then _I_ saw him too34160.04871928285
 It was not all settled before Monday: as soon      as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn175629.23858716796
 But our visitor      was very obstinate205.0808665636088
 I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real      defect of his character after all13494.543119625578
 He has been accused of many      faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one34545.306403799754
 Nothing was      to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do      not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your      uncle would most readily have settled the whole101614665872.90231
 They battled it      together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman      or lady concerned in it deserved64506.68096785472
 But, Lizzy, this must go no farther      than yourself, or Jane at most7479.819450587429
 You know pretty well, I suppose,      what has been done for the young people82149.4627821551
 His debts are to be paid,      amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,      another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his      commission purchased231974384.14750347
 It was owing to him, to his      reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character      had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been      received and noticed as he was383947067.2409802
 Perhaps there was some truth in      _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_      reserve, can be answerable for the event1895757.5615129403
 But in spite of all this      fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that      your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit      for _another interest_ in the affair1393707507.2103665
 When all this was resolved      on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at      Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more      when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to      receive the last finish179436087068.3358
 I believe I have now told you every thing1192.2275395706968
      It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I      hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure786806.9364242667
 Lydia came to      us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house3130.877771983629
 _He_ was      exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I      would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour      while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter      last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a      piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no      fresh pain5.644140735218118e+17
 I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,      representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and      all the unhappiness she had brought on her family46262061.1530585
 If she heard me,      it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen2732824.9213857707
 I was      sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth      and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her193901.14372935763
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy was      punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the      wedding18053.10847495985
 He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again      on Wednesday or Thursday136238.271763427
 Will you be very angry with me, my dear      Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold      enough to say before) how much I like him59148368.41093817
 His behaviour to us has,      in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire44269.03831985267
      His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but      a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his      wife may teach him5786842.416169243
 I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever      mentioned your name475.4126867205495
 But slyness seems the fashion126.09100922058126
 Pray forgive      me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so      far, as to exclude me from P6347877.600360626
 But I must write no more400.3473188153528
      The children have been wanting me this half hour487.52904889653405
 Your's, very      sincerely,       "M284.2235956570565
 GARDINER28.97482899810657
"  The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share565701.009020039
 The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr444.7902802016157
 Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce2.408113812857817e+20
 He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem9821.294590703412
 Her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her21800.650905990628
 But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham38994782187.8194
 Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection1502.6427534006841
 He had to be sure done much1154.1136367932472
 But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief7258.694699373482
 It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned611881024441472.2
 It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return290101.23721175024
 They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing to him14372.942271251695
 Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him73972.09543399868
 For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him5713.6216969705265
 Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself396562.5990896862
 She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again1659.775781429976
 It was hardly enough; but it pleased her2383.8240970028774
 She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr164356.2070655818
 Darcy and herself118.86235509921774
  She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham10971426.049919829
  "I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her1687050.2398108863
  "You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome2372124.369672823
"  "I should be sorry indeed, if it were5298.568352185427
 _We_ were always good friends; and now we are better7396.224992087513
 Are the others coming out?"  "I do not know14334.902858651503
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton957.9628990883897
 And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley1566224.9658160019
"  She replied in the affirmative440.2799588097829
  "I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle37271992.155309156
 And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me377304.5264635257
 But of course she did not mention my name to you6565.928440639061
"  "Yes, she did646.2046917793542
"  "And what did she say?"  "That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well7927637.840683008
 At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented54851.13958747043
"  "Certainly," he replied, biting his lips1568.0833116504525
 Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,  "I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month2196158.6318876133
 We passed each other several times204.76880502947637
"  "Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth17811.05022578466
 "It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year12235.509212239042
"  "Undoubtedly87.15790790360987
 Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had30803.05053967178
"  "Yes; he introduced us to his sister506.97475102037805
"  "And do you like her?"  "Very much10985.933029448162
"  "I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two165059.21776238308
 When I last saw her, she was not very promising26160.44148578673
 I am very glad you liked her423.8629917813991
 I hope she will turn out well257.8439595101357
"  "I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age7638.285690857624
"  "Did you go by the village of Kympton?"  "I do not recollect that we did140819.29829363278
"  "I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had116391.45978869591
 A most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect11961.49441087374
 I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing457783.4257979514
 One ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be167980418269.46744
 Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"  "I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron262713610956.6888
"  "You have144.20442276304
 Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the first, you may remember2726192.945187515
"  They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,  "Come, Mr70402460039.9778
 Do not let us quarrel about the past546.0410343277988
   Mr7.838204499203478
 Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet48335034505.75741
  The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs2058.789244700279
  "Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"  "Oh, lord! I don't know35170639.1555558
 Not these two or three years perhaps652.6552836074541
"  "Write to me very often, my dear2666.2677797174147
"  "As often as I can567.415434747614
 But you know married women have never much time for writing599.749089333463
 My sisters may write to _me_549.3176271795509
 They will have nothing else to do586.942533540547
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's583.5973789183103
 He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things4210.0669645872495
  "He is as fine a fellow," said Mr3776.5186156778213
 Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw744961.1375387042
 He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all963.5538027666632
 I am prodigiously proud of him168.4190156307115
 I defy even Sir William Lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law2058.441985408047
"  The loss of her daughter made Mrs1234.5513152080055
 Bennet very dull for several days171.53858246255314
  "I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends491045.4603286695
 One seems so forlorn without them156.92606205103272
"  "This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth200631.66586291988
 "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single1260.4063614175343
"  "It is no such thing278.2667655724896
 Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off38654.321133301724
 If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon39298.70017992303
 The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks3449071.2361152787
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet was quite in the fidgets201.0034497084647
 She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns8539.175072462913
  "Well, well, and so Mr2661.1913385143885
 Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs1603.9454697882052
 Philips first brought her the news240.91023297270664
) "Well, so much the better1115.5327362717298
 Not that I care about it, though3228.5482529326723
 But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it706917.4294564137
 And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us10772.745244166688
 You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it10213.078117259516
 Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true305257128.2398863
 He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday947.3719939354829
 She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed20872206.36169116
"  Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour211932.56041162202
 It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,  "I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed3027098477768.48
 I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at143884.46302537923
 I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain33006.993903824194
"  Elizabeth did not know what to make of it4006.9546636072146
  "Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself138030444.76075518
"  In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it425330235.21058047
  The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again301249.8408166091
  "As soon as ever Mr882.409057079902
 Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs2058.8471969903044
 Bennet, "you will wait on him of course3202.2157910136057
"  "No, no182.28798390892229
 You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters694594.5029797792
 But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again99168.4303029091
"  His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield154120.16814110798
  "'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he1903.5370363880882
 "If he wants our society, let him seek it880.6112070091871
 He knows where we live169.5155397996147
 I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again209927.39077599597
"  "Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him1257987.6539522943
 But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined72768.4854972641
 We must have Mrs122.79345667231023
 Long and the Gouldings soon193.65026442850245
 That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him7218.618455399397
 Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_ did8557.087097291022
 As the day of his arrival drew near,  "I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister152173262.78286988
 "It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of9214706.350023724
 My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she says1638758.8472811654
 Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"  "I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power5894934164.421564
 You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much903786.3243139811
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Bingley arrived89.23917453982581
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could275335958.3063582
 She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before4977.690730835601
 But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house1082225.09300246
  Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy511.3549426110098
 Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr527247.7924271596
 Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister11873.661558296984
  "There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"  "Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know737275946648.9355
"  "La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before80221.10593362733
 Mr7.838204499203478
 what's his name124.47197966690912
 That tall, proud man157.73730361574454
 Darcy!--and so it does I vow204.54747052974528
 Well, any friend of Mr199.4043537651817
 Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him98790.08671588918
"  Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern394.4993281537203
 Both sisters were uncomfortable enough190.05912629853367
 Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr4814986.370730712
 Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr13723.265975158129
 Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them1695.5176085499954
 But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs6260345.7151706265
 Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him3581.1977536435043
 To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley988721646952513.4
 Her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire15365754.587945573
  "Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation668903.4235010032
"  She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door25497295.078194994
 Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected5078.346678390427
  Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command959324.9623179851
 She had ventured only one glance at Darcy315.02791291195626
 He looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley90555859.00528176
 But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt127676.43914109076
 It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture2118.4302894949724
  Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed117880.19847664371
 He was received by Mrs170.81180700354832
 Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend285848.5719051002
  Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr428.57278761751024
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing33126.38734147741
 He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire2368696.759116033
 There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself69324.46662046577
 But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground1853110987.012524
 More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed4514.748723228895
 She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so780.857735018896
  "Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she14220.08583711671
 "Yet why did he come?"  She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak21166503.27815117
  She enquired after his sister, but could do no more3140.8521184999704
  "It is a long time, Mr1370.0035008274601
 Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs3349.1649997214336
 Bennet26.587121706548537
  "I began to be afraid you would never come back again1827.6690538859466
 People _did_ say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true17557283.79281415
 A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away7093.056574555337
 Miss Lucas is married and settled194.85318099853552
 And one of my own daughters1413.4033031861575
 I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers449157.5840299644
 It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be1476465.1790045132
 It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq1584.1632886248412
 Did you see it?"  Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations57970.374765100445
 Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes227.50798368862624
 How Mr84.33932984188637
  "It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr1286945172.478789
 Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me42082.53338259145
 They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long1858526.7477629848
 Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves17253.320722991666
"  Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr988.0128935609138
 Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat77092.55628064486
 It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present2666510179.0754385
 A few weeks, he believed512.1013356844949
  "When you have killed all your own birds, Mr1298.8935712004918
 Bingley," said her mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr3676789.438041264
 Bennet's manor90.24874843588687
 I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you559682.2157362367
"  Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion463440545.94552416
 At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion53986.595703904044
  "The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them33554031.71252085
 Their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!"  Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover4316917455.944347
 When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention717770.8547366518
 He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty5212029.505079458
 Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever2060380.5261715613
 But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent248391.67985787886
  When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs1275.9930649774553
 Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time533281.0202434382
  "You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr1699.582173005124
 Bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned44124804.03654756
 I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement32588367.89177848
"  Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business255244.25370904314
 They then went away174.44306221764217
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year2659974194175.3364
     CHAPTER XII45.44094002286213
   As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more301059.78873355145
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her162.26205267991838
  "Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?"  She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure481121669.0022271
  "He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teazing, teazing, man! I will think no more about him173309413261.8767
"  Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth14279764.659755925
  "Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy266294.3520863687
 I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming37624.153879443125
 I am glad he dines here on Tuesday386.3644429588062
 It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance11599.293343293448
"  "Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly11956.877941805535
 "Oh, Jane, take care676.9707022272995
"  "I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever148119.0211857849
 Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived74038599.77659482
  On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two, who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time511047012.80091417
 When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister92856268.95577548
  Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend2227.974001750039
 Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm1182.4312804864994
  His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured343191870202.7628
 It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour74397.86250336084
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them33745.09772035417
 He was on one side of her mother1918.141132585375
 She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did80194859.87000293
 Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family8120736075.73823
  She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance223858448.33220983
 Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil275307.9731416726
 She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend86071.0576324631
  "If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for ever17113327.31059622
"  The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair38026292775171.164
 And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,  "The men shan't come and part us, I am determined914523110.2117953
 We want none of them; do we?"  Darcy had walked away to another part of the room34539.606973032416
"  "And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"  "Mrs11558.531755178647
 The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks996.2232607305654
"  She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success2558321.920962353
 He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away251444690.33341384
  When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party4173490861181.708
 She now lost every expectation of pleasure387.0776783494634
 Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them12405495.361704417
 The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw782.8614674286176
 The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week; and even Mr11510.859330315241
 Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least870266.6240575863
 And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty83641.60063463029
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not5055.624633529529
 And what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs1980.0705277759841
 Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last2059.933154106552
' She did indeed218.72237150806245
 I do think Mrs116.25935753508938
 Long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously457544.4315655261
"  Mrs21.994241784043503
 Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals2.7293817806226684e+16
  "It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth99242.53848159975
 "The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other1312.4629065782374
"  Elizabeth smiled100.52484108045435
 It mortifies me93.48648031574903
 I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it598619.2024112636
 I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection80038.3882049717
 It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man658108.7583728837
"  "You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment63041919.16958187
"  "How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"  "And how impossible in others!"  "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"  "That is a question which I hardly know how to answer887121499824.6506
 We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing5061.590418978324
 Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your confidante321754.00438105053
"     CHAPTER XIII59.279486696303046
 Bingley called again, and alone906.6592036509716
 His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time46449.24070212722
 He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits30705.576033100664
 Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere251684.7997542029
  "Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky231174.63771147485
"  He should be particularly happy at any time, &c1756.6779128332419
; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them48194.62728345473
  "Can you come to-morrow?"  Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity3001071.270657528
  He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed1236290.4516196495
 In ran Mrs93.09157244864586
 Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,  "My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down11277594.141384132
 He is come--Mr108.63072573808836
 Bingley is come122.98221608555453
--He is, indeed320.392704718351
 Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown19440.55741323103
 Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair139.9052799140101
"  "We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago18827853732.274113
"  "Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! where is your sash my dear?"  But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters2136124461.537352
  The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening7709.973464573344
 After tea, Mr118.81500998524369
 Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument34349.793211022516
 Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs523.5473688897648
 Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them8252.275514012874
 Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"  "Nothing child, nothing43041866552.39481
 I did not wink at you305.89571361759056
" She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,  "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room6450421508.392551
 Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it2240721.5811217176
 Bennet half opened the door and called out,  "Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you1488960.9633326165
  "We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall9990807.883379713
"  Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room8123633.893958714
 Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual244.45359112169564
 Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter9946.104470792377
 His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter40621861.91786271
  He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs185263.2797100985
 Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband6298.850352513073
 Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr386856.50171853293
 Darcy returned within the stated time185.67833875771072
 Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence96760.75709276844
  Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr2161.832578467745
 Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on1924.165314964724
 The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected594.1840486820435
 There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him18544196.912220404
  But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her148161860.59407508
 On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all2810808881.964566
 _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she thought was still worse11286.644310462572
 Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room20760505144.798683
  Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world63854609.050964035
  "'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much20344.186006563195
 I do not deserve it295.07747613944554
 Oh! why is not every body as happy?"  Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express130695.06392857448
 But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present7993970.639954219
 He is gone to my father already629.6955255228389
  Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation5636756.203728566
  "And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"  In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose459399910864.4745
  "Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door152830.39145339432
  "With my mother up stairs235.86165990852516
 Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship2672.2508046426788
 They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself4.042915266487287e+17
  It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever14099142.633232534
 Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon1402.9213348686317
 Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr54550674.60971542
 Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was3564.7055143746925
  Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said,  "Jane, I congratulate you37476772674.78014
 You will be a very happy woman1828.2866550720858
"  Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness12885.99236127529
 I have not a doubt of your doing very well together1687.0179343646175
 Your tempers are by no means unlike733.5684239236242
 You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income11881204.872398136
"  "I hope not so323.3287579611654
 Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in _me_4132.292190330365
"  "Exceed their income! My dear Mr625.2804180623837
 Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more10526335.401530536
" Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night172925335.5874737
 I knew how it would be1197.9441045843269
 I always said it must be so, at last3939.6998835439463
 I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together4878320416.2176695
 Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"  Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten54389.20102319138
 At that moment, she cared for no other1325.6685107545927
 Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense117505.73826233356
  Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter41128.023432991664
  Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept97712681919.33974
 In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief776248413.1202552
  "He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible4631877038.554971
"  "I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth1822.8324553351285
 "But how did he account for it?"  "It must have been his sister's doing717573.4566250873
 They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects1709483.1228299006
 But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other9255753420.624775
"  This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities141661.71366562968
 Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness9445.671669957606
 No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr25349078.271174744
 Collins in time112.54945766159635
"  The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret23986.98716720525
 Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs244.72851293820656
 Philips, and _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton272602.0592429981
  The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune249424896.56542817
     CHAPTER XIV56.24636485292475
   One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn277994673415.7209
 It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours465172.3546337539
 The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them40702.724919012995
 As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery47087290.32844776
 They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered13171594.38508174
 It was lady Catherine de Bourgh340.6558966589676
  They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs230130.5440333234
 Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt135333.0816240375
  She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word4901316.057368093
 Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made222104.61935306012
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness16202.273887722851
 After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,  "I hope you are well, Miss Bennet26489212.400853366
 That lady I suppose is your mother513.8099854808854
"  Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was1136.206654996921
  "And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters14968.603365955001
"  "Yes, madam," said Mrs1420.1113191506354
 Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine1075.1501680836896
 "She is my youngest girl but one480.22474037525706
 My youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who I believe will soon become a part of the family34453926.654300675
"  "You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short silence16640.26944835747
  "It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's20188446.688885417
"  "This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west145074.2732636785
"  Mrs21.994241784043503
 Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added,  "May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr4149834.859363976
 and Mrs18.885291888671958
 Collins well87.25077719703147
 I saw them the night before last314.67261019519873
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,  "Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn2406049068898.0894
 I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company750610.8111521542
"  "Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the different walks574737.8797019337
 I think she will be pleased with the hermitage2348.0226181439457
 As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on11298328.176814664
  Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it93357.092656933
 They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable4804342.12192906
  "How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face718763.0890275597
  As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:--  "You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither272330314.24113315
"  Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment150.25547180958117
  "Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam2726.8335935332493
 I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here68443.43755685039
"  "Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with4001166929.6869617
 But however insincere _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so418630.3630109394
 A report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago2611.2776087484485
 I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr4067603181.4904184
 Darcy19.074490057073533
"  "If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far104374587.90372004
"  "If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"  "I never heard that it was1335202936.020062
"  "And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"  "I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship4019619.0470369696
 _You_ may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer35573.185253750366
"  "This is not to be borne1584.547970195125
 Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"  "Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible1711713.5730138961
"  "It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason313177.0334225757
 But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family12271039.282528715
"  "If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it77558.14372061777
 I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns48751.566187524426
"  "Let me be rightly understood228.4945256338163
 This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place8540.948900009484
 No, never145.10434983677533
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_489.92033433887275
 Now what have you to say?"  "Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me385875322.4806236
"  Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,  "The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind692728.5650483199
 From their infancy, they have been intended for each other811.0335544917453
 It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of her's30278.708639404915
 While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"  "Yes, and I had heard it before1.417460682027207e+21
 But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh2164048231.783345
 You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage4070.0070257953043
 Its completion depended on others144.25618588900386
 Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"  "Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it273024399.44503486
 You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him6899.224306498718
 Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us12558.627363548747
"  "These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth1358.3397756146805
 "But the wife of Mr210.51851257917392
 Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine971177.9557656499
"  "Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score?  "Let us sit down2796039.495547022
 You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it1079547.7637715465
 I have not been used to submit to any person's whims1941.4807500790428
 I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment1589.2075119866993
"  "_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_226773.66513432725
"  "I will not be interrupted896.397312022323
 Hear me in silence193.1026353600985
 My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other612.2716246311159
 They are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families1890523.2714472394
 Their fortune on both sides is splendid272.27738208790623
 They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune6346638.609236858
 If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up9802870.011891218
"  "In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere8468.589351183842
 He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal25507.562060499073
"  "True85.8508813555486
 But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition10657.993376412809
"  Lady Catherine seemed pleased201.28231741923767
  "And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"  "I will make no promise of the kind828262.990318123
"  "Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished460.0717737885534
 I expected to find a more reasonable young woman761.3655923139544
 But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede1251.7729568781192
 I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require16101.729980809281
 I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable1984.6537444863432
 You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these30066.967280331955
 How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine643302.065626878
 I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject31638.222115789125
"  "Not so hasty, if you please1929.5593870742891
 I have by no means done663.4642415995104
 To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add53149.650700513586
 I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles1256905.0861020128
 And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is _her_ husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"  "You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered21007214933837.535
 "You have insulted me, in every possible method3632.903995075517
"  And she rose as she spoke812.8388759271608
 Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back3182.610343343063
 Her ladyship was highly incensed268.33008673699
  "You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"  "Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say8645974778399.883
 You know my sentiments142.71552809687356
"  "You are then resolved to have him?"  "I have said no such thing97518.65539358008
 I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me32456167.736853212
"  "It is well250.27487382400165
 You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude748.6557721034915
 You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world1927749.854151768
"  "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance2799681.3223460787
 No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr4126.599164491409
 Darcy19.074490057073533
 And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn76235675202.32864
 I shall now know how to act569.9823381671564
 Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified46630.91633193363
 I came to try you180.19267816046002
 I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point2787.659738943532
"  In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,  "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet1652583664.4031677
 I send no compliments to your mother386.81451477977805
 I am most seriously displeased148.98101685022735
"  Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself464206.98187387874
 She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs644.6860506512172
 Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself66858.88542079058
  "She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go2064617.2978643794
 She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you460047.63064958365
     CHAPTER XV45.44094002286213
   The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly13749691.451425767
 It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea554658447875027.9
 She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together57670.638933220536
  In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference3168854.9041054454
 From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce57250128145.17257
 She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side211729092939485.75
 With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning134513.85747531924
  If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him5429180279.067871
 In that case he would return no more617.0889405215346
 Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way418286.29071598203
 If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all4304118.6423173705
"         *       *       *       *       *  The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs3603769777.05467
 Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject12144.379576667834
  The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand211746107.3229346
  "Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room572908.8313007987
 It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations208942.19232234664
  She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down40349.176869538685
 He then said,  "I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly52630.81411711472
 As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents2123.738750214776
 I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony111174.40437658256
 Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest1430.1109513994543
"  The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,  "You look conscious343805847560.2867
 Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer5914150.270921651
 Collins34.01810605666633
"  "From Mr134.4572089161344
 Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?"  "Something very much to the purpose of course2542331.52022369
 He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases1579890.8706794938
 I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point4022.879158259065
 What relates to yourself, is as follows374.61349467551713
 "Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs271.4023797287492
 Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority2128922.045685315
"  "Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage94880803.40171942
 Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of7425901550.315377
"  "Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out21673.41925900681
"  "My motive for cautioning you, is as follows537.0939274062998
 We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye831726.6724044988
"  "_Mr95.58814942058355
 Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you3399121.992858079
 Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr3006047.7706700894
 Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!"  Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile5017879851.319661
 Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her5425.14156550619
  "Are you not diverted?"  "Oh! yes17027.641150909625
"  "After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match262944400248.0421
 I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned716111067.9841207
" "Mr27.541780616983342
 Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known390369727.25142527
 I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married11238681.659538018
 It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it86517.85831877402
 You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing78074.56797945903
" "_That_ is his notion of christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch10559788.504852042
 You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report416955.5535048011
 But it is so strange!"  "Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing20427.447884315254
 Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr35192979075.1144
 Collins's correspondence for any consideration187.65983170443437
 Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law3890504.8539240006
 Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not202636.05419744135
 It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried4066.363853317562
 Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_140062083.03014442
     CHAPTER XVI56.24636485292475
   Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr5070.32961461856
 Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit440331.87053565914
 The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs2595.8518254144274
 It was agreed to219.5167039875875
 Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them6290.819163936572
 They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other29416.778673260946
 Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same4033200.604675636
  They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone43750710.78587674
 Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said,  "Mr822636.1690004058
 Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's62949647.652043365
 I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister2352.5881421774493
 Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it1029835.0700861169
 Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express454588.885366624
 I did not think Mrs326.0685410045978
 Gardiner was so little to be trusted450.96517872680124
"  "You must not blame my aunt497.22791206585003
 Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars19289733.67392802
 Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them99657223.07730944
 That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny3683278.0863347445
 Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of _you_198679.73414756247
"  Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word1691.2615523313966
 After a short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me181098.40872077725
 If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once7583.077940309538
 _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever29061.28834064788
"  Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances123809967993.36491
 The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do144963295.59936905
 Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable410359425362264.56
  They walked on, without knowing in what direction1399.6958101067721
 There was too much to be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects682035.1748765932
 She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give4.107592675542662e+18
 But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise2421.840327799597
  "It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before990800.2410431501
 I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly14504053.03355188
"  Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_6637210.661639756
 After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations45248.47818009112
"  "What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof180080526.24671045
 It was unpardonable101.47727659666765
 I cannot think of it without abhorrence442.6522245636984
 "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility900143.9114430362
"  "I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself1646.404967595654
 The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me448954377.5519114
 Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner18162.85841484699
' Those were your words165.2606350902555
 You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice1791327.9923003821
"  "I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression5763.913743190033
 I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way148260.43389732216
"  "I can easily believe it368.03042799889096
 You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did8977.919737738723
 The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me9782254.38973783
"  "Oh! do not repeat what I then said802.0587217543264
 These recollections will not do at all731.1925010416433
 I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it19233.369866423367
"  Darcy mentioned his letter173.79786630999445
 "Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"  She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed48891919819.33023
  "I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary1396901.3024935813
 I hope you have destroyed the letter635.6970211060004
 There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again263059.56488971977
 I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me529.2012061645457
"  "The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies1154358785.8665547
"  "When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit1110691042.0020428
"  "The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so99208.89997674794
 But think no more of the letter1176.3687116854956
 The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten230267801.6078916
 You must learn some of my philosophy315.9177079454387
 Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure1000.0934773529524
"  "I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind1236.1923015914026
 _Your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance17092165.80335835
 But with _me_, it is not so21665.43858907605
 Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled7270.338846985765
 I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle57557.73894164377
 As a child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper69200.842100627
 I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit1613.0132931849892
 Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_) I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own188006958211758.47
 Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous8797668.389103357
 By you, I was properly humbled2247.1823481748975
 I came to you without a doubt of my reception1208.6573695701163
 You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased2690.5318274051583
"  "Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"  "Indeed I had61894.09082447732
 What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses13496.257839589969
"  "My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you27201.30144071623
 How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"  "Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction83879748.85736488
"  "I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley10725.644699055776
 You blamed me for coming?"  "No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise22160.646433562448
"  "Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you18037.793471253586
 My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due4235466.9717718735
 How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you752199.7996046676
  She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther493606.211130101
  After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home45744307.85170962
  "What could become of Mr172.59917428534015
 Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs7523.773446554235
 Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it12735.981224373027
  "Not at all182.94868313671262
 I guessed as much139.01179010798958
" And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case110040.37650253993
  "On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago174819954.29522222
 His surprise was great159.44489787021868
 He had never had the slightest suspicion523.2879138865053
 I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together362482753336.08856
"  Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend1804.8078819894592
  "Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"  "From the former802649037.4439
"  "And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him39582.39179444239
"  "It did134.78275928841305
 His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy209412.75700304512
 I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him157971.12345205757
 He was angry132.72714797202366
 But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments111075.77797351133
"  Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr326.14791505486227
 Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself69834.5807001405
 She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin139783.27729903135
 In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house3354038.091604366
 In the hall they parted351.495275568807
   "My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table17794858248.31465
 She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge607835.6636530199
 She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth84185.2021829159
  The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary1316.5704558586958
 The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent601.5458071270425
 Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her13745063512.510138
 She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away572418938.2427987
  At night she opened her heart to Jane412.53604044869576
 Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here18161.581018536286
  "You are joking, Lizzy386.3121409862149
 This cannot be!--engaged to Mr127.91291124980667
 Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me5580.210617689771
 I know it to be impossible501.34656800353844
"  "This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not21917679.10404993
 Yet, indeed, I am in earnest14976.64009238299
 I speak nothing but the truth406.34304900134055
 He still loves me, and we are engaged3282.2915977853104
"  Jane looked at her doubtingly478.10064957949504
 I know how much you dislike him549.8656424273704
"  "You know nothing of the matter538.7048403883261
 _That_ is all to be forgot1387.7609791261718
 Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now17179.245707792994
 But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable2349.4003441939785
 This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself2205.497569671722
"  Miss Bennet still looked all amazement319.6693460929432
 "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"  "There can be no doubt of that359649109.4070641
 It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world88145.28468166445
 But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"  "Very, very much645001.9921550181
 Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight337.55900885777083
 But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible1836.7869719210732
 And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection69490.81499111865
 Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"  "Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all7390100233.788247
 I am afraid you will be angry1254.7264912029104
"  "My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious1947.3033376684386
 I want to talk very seriously335.42341330448835
 Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay32335.70984112862
 Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"  "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began24165016.322061017
 But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley3218.496969495733
"  Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment3852842.3031713986
 When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish6936.253426242153
  "Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself1799454.3723236348
 Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me86308709.34920588
 How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you9196463.250532998
 She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend6157734.225221833
 But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage5185.3446532496955
 All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation1246.673458315108
 Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr113478.79249403188
 Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company586799800.4868057
 What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way6100204.121001017
"  Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet53630.66269985626
  As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr178694348.8532821
 Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"  "I advise Mr112508.29523648719
 Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs11475.080197318171
 Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning1849.7468609220211
 It is a nice long walk, and Mr1015.8452073868428
 Darcy has never seen the view231.71866634914886
 Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty652284.2401783066
 Wont it, Kitty?"  Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home12304.983004189718
 Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented21968.781740852315
 Bennet followed her, saying,  "I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself18730877.96636611
 But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then785505479.4600515
 So, do not put yourself to inconvenience1173.756087408201
"  During their walk, it was resolved that Mr2600.938496883484
 Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's724.7987383917247
 She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man123140.44567441361
 But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr461593760.4870865
 Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation7087.604461427695
         *       *       *       *       *  In the evening, soon after Mr9650.190499319218
 Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme29912.224479476587
 She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr340581795637610.75
 Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile505262.55222370196
" She was gone directly352.1333647630342
  Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious7259.2412363605
 Darcy19.074490057073533
  "Or in other words, you are determined to have him5939.501095010225
 But will they make you happy?"  "Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?"  "None at all181224461.18170983
 We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him531547.7891435026
 He is perfectly amiable200.7672573160238
 You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms238623.99646993625
"  "Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent235773.57475645468
 He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask6433541.914811674
 I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him103023.38617159678
 But let me advise you to think better of it2136.0973346048886
 I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior128427.89918661727
 Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage1885.4358892967996
 You could scarcely escape discredit and misery215.06942576658864
 My child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life68996.65795589761
 You know not what you are about826.988681936336
"  Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr87338.05362062385
 Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match50445593438.58593
  "Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say18877709.642589327
 If this be the case, he deserves you1442.713430977305
"  To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr1054.0809551055638
 Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia235.24880292493685
 He heard her with astonishment150.70767439758532
  "This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the better41393445.6582533
 It will save me a world of trouble and economy489.0092390180134
 Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way301765.0427971956
 I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter3644011.294060993
 Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure4108164953.179877
"  Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure66905517.10490066
 Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time246047834.61111367
  When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication238418.20010903728
 Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs1789.9707827935238
 Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable661.3075472558073
 Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them5754762728.4931965
 She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself43119.76547660657
  "Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr1203.0367902419894
 Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all286955916.0391698
 I am so pleased--so happy221.96809917371849
 Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before82109.79765849834
 I hope he will overlook it260.0513159598211
 Dear, dear Lizzy380.47515935821764
 A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me1067003.504218101
 I shall go distracted155.0707041363697
"  This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away2231407.085305134
 But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her37308.8202520776
 You must and shall be married by a special licence612.8155464379416
 But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr717.3816835500943
"  This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for2786322133.6035357
 But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs1926.101540552181
 Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion136685702.13878477
  Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr55951.80522195487
 Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem12196.914461398997
  "I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he4097.795158687834
   Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr1187.1927730192415
 "How could you begin?" said she1586.4543599044705
 "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"  "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation123783957564.82047
 I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun25823.855677783467
 Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"  "For the liveliness of your mind, I did407771.70655050053
"  "You may as well call it impertinence at once1300.8131179562488
 It was very little less561.768080509006
 The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention32970.43387169035
 You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone17249.175267061175
 I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_9798.36362228805
 Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you772121610.9777603
 There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable769828.9968926741
 To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love69989.6911626512
"  "Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?"  "Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means83818831.25390169
 My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last11474785243076.598
 What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"  "Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement71760063602.24738
"  "But I was embarrassed484.7392242307483
"  "And so was I228.42784758174722
"  "A man who had felt less, might1224.4043978740817
"  "How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself66468464731.1497
 I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect1434705.0121440035
"  "You need not distress yourself334.4746875174767
 The moral will be perfectly fair220.0986351889935
 Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts6194.5476593734475
 I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude2609.5090309530474
 My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing107600.65691250651
"  "Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use719246.1596028102
 But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?"  "My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me2163497659380.7598
 My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made752913647.0116915
"  "Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to befall her?"  "I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth12646512.514603723
 But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly4790101.919664496
"  "And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did16071321.18173951
"  From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr534.8811626090852
 Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs1907.1648483545857
 Gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:       "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have      done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but      to say the truth, I was too cross to write1.9795965521118093e+18
 You supposed more than      really existed182.36983816444072
 But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a      loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible      flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me      actually married, you cannot greatly err18887705.94416502
 You must write again very      soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last56578.53843175639
 I      thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes58298.27249542889
 How could I      be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful28374.78639882494
      We will go round the Park every day513.5987342577378
 I am the happiest creature in      the world702.920094648526
 Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one      with such justice10038.902308494002
 I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I      laugh993.070381002194
 Mr7.838204499203478
 Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can      spare from me56079.497291755906
 You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas1965.3710871247526
       Your's, &c58.7559004982313
"  Mr16.23186713533009
 Bennet sent to Mr113.31930883991463
 Collins, in reply to his last590.0476751422938
       "DEAR SIR,       "I must trouble you once more for congratulations16064.703234915462
 Elizabeth will      soon be the wife of Mr434.45141022245724
 Darcy19.074490057073533
 Console Lady Catherine as well as      you can3663.5182219033486
 But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew43532.02190580844
 He has      more to give228.80781312817425
       "Your's sincerely, &c122.27256982914732
  The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it5744.337129172257
 Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister98695.51466951412
  Before any answer could arrive from Mr218.62288545915544
 The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident812.6278676549342
 Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over1715504.480058103
 At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr513330649.5914764
 Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband1795.6887896757066
 He bore it however with admirable calmness434.2808733493026
 If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight101699.78313559746
  Mrs9.810835553236354
 Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs14046.837812718619
 Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar247168492.55165103
 Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant881073.2094674773
 Elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley2.533507398429363e+19
   Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs1024.616171080107
 Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters432.066392948386
 With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs222.05164373090363
 Bingley and talked of Mrs199.26674204186972
 Darcy may be guessed130.51669989489653
 I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly6320829326692076.0
  Mr7.838204499203478
 Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do28251.19192175146
 Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth468.6680550178793
 So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart976731.994871464
 The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other47746514.572713815
  Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters41682.890071277354
 She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid8309329.324290221
 From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs14756.534022086451
  Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs113102.52271358194
 Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone208.84319825900477
 Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance138267560622.1284
  As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters20349.562554253374
 He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune3455024425.268388
 The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished10518806.712402193
 The letter was to this effect:       "MY DEAR LIZZY,       "I wish you joy1317588.1600336006
 If you love Mr121.1959712346881
 Darcy half as well as I do my dear      Wickham, you must be very happy196429.2044053776
 It is a great comfort to have you      so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will      think of us29812609.277148455
 I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very      much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live      upon without some help8207757.196078158
 Any place would do, of about three or four      hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr996566.8765767659
 Darcy about it,      if you had rather not7899.267963159221
       "Yours, &c65.08088488885085
"  As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind390529.00455205876
 Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them71732591.83536738
 It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills7669439064.402503
 Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme32514.92785760796
 They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought40077.52198693838
 His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her30964369.359661423
  Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession173479.83813836335
 Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone7588815504.531643
  Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see138795.85026031136
 They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended22938.333828579518
 Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother3334552.7050707196
 He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry87764.38604461537
 Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way1595.705159491711
 By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself2421192.747162182
  Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end230533122865.54282
 But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city3.0010982787311554e+20
  With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms9051.303265607525
 Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them557013665.3047619
