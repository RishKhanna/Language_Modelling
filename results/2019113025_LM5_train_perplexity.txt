     CHAPTER I	953.5291521241652
   It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife	1.7190327869477838e+25
  However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters	1.7407099092420187e+49
  "My dear Mr	86546.77176208477
 Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"  Mr	2.478351895228348e+25
 Bennet replied that he had not	7736347.580833081
 Long has just been here, and she told me all about it	39309802802191.98
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
  "_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it	4.529849813486071e+17
"  This was invitation enough	734646.865442686
  "Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs	775112681382.6758
 Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week	1.616241678581067e+29
"  "What is his name?"  "Bingley	69846370171.56177
"  "Is he married or single?"  "Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year	6.086559883905056e+33
 What a fine thing for our girls!"  "How so? how can it affect them?"  "My dear Mr	1.413383073679629e+24
 Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them	1.8723612876635437e+28
"  "Is that his design in settling here?"  "Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes	2.4206466035421922e+50
"  "I see no occasion for that	717564898.5232714
 You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr	1.3689376822340466e+34
 Bingley might like you the best of the party	5731988405.766819
"  "My dear, you flatter me	755163208.2308961
 I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now	1.989590601833649e+22
 When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty	1.6231557258107419e+19
"  "In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of	4.269408339147253e+16
"  "But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr	629055984367053.9
 Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood	52001503.11155059
"  "It is more than I engage for, I assure you	58620056505150.555
"  "But consider your daughters	6920101.923487257
 Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them	4093423941106.4717
 Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not	2.9601210245191127e+22
"  "You are over scrupulous surely	71844602.4948752
 I dare say Mr	75584.2064285483
 Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy	1.880669118019772e+47
 Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia	7.834762955224772e+29
 But you are always giving _her_ the preference	47688316089.24656
"  "They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters	5.462787704373852e+36
"  "Mr	10876.835996291326
 Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me	2.12629834036829e+20
 You have no compassion on my poor nerves	421154169.7974156
"  "You mistake me, my dear	753205346.3466948
 I have a high respect for your nerves	470079542.405375
 They are my old friends	584947.5405859204
 I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least	23106500241206.227
"  "Ah! you do not know what I suffer	462263705282.76807
"  "But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood	1.1678369032368524e+27
"  "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them	2.2734825600211317e+21
"  "Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all	3.484921551539387e+20
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character	5.1894057957783686e+35
 _Her_ mind was less difficult to develope	5837685093.503891
 She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper	381638241322444.56
 When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous	544854843.8534635
     CHAPTER II	753.0020911079799
   Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bingley	99.51115896130685
 He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it	7.953923946128607e+37
 It was then disclosed in the following manner	715094808.5106649
 Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,  "I hope Mr	3.1589440196642616e+20
 Bingley will like it Lizzy	642243.461738391
"  "We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr	551588004369953.2
 Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit	3.577554523620781e+16
 Long has promised to introduce him	5392382.032674866
"  "I do not believe Mrs	78212742.07154834
 Long will do any such thing	5907715.862095384
 She has two nieces of her own	60545365.71779819
 She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her	5252928776133086.0
"  "No more have I," said Mr	88240166392.81798
 Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you	4.4504208079325486e+18
"  Mrs	1017.6641180120203
 Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters	1.6604506545119416e+20
  "Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves	1.7620591229377128e+19
 You tear them to pieces	620700.6896044408
"  "Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill	3.481665557478508e+20
"  "I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully	3068578270793456.5
  "When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"  "To-morrow fortnight	3774469487562052.5
"  "Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs	7.670756478686232e+16
"  "Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr	5.13034190431063e+19
 Bingley to _her_	912621.6503780178
"  "Impossible, Mr	1011774.6922269703
 Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?"  "I honour your circumspection	1.5621807801772312e+26
 A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little	46551414.091486394
 One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight	321185147574505.8
 But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs	2.884421704426625e+18
 Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself	8.197234772414384e+33
"  The girls stared at their father	56883045.11939012
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!"  "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he	2.4060768949331718e+24
 What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts	1.9129014976127923e+26
"  Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how	35938017812743.195
  "While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr	3.9038774126763684e+18
"  "I am sick of Mr	79015960.65549383
 Bingley," cried his wife	7946208.724963348
  "I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him	7.791064511606479e+36
 It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now	1.8715122188092965e+20
"  The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs	4877899306812625.0
 Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while	1.3083457607943034e+30
  "How good it was in you, my dear Mr	723329326615.5045
 Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last	429210910151.17017
 Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now	1.2428821903401769e+34
"  "Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr	4.670937915990498e+18
 Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife	4.164033350649503e+20
  "What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut	3.986244487579889e+19
 "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter	1.7473056645247778e+23
 At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing	8.10886814717996e+33
 Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr	4.233595673458337e+17
"  "Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, I'm the tallest	3.9138976675245054e+27
"  The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr	3.087927204729615e+16
 Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner	3489800321998.976
     CHAPTER III	746.2740688337336
 Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr	1.2036799613223544e+29
 Bingley	99.51115896130685
 Her report was highly favourable	579158.7407533042
 Sir William had been delighted with him	51795415.52771198
 Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr	8.882980309837226e+25
 Bingley's heart were entertained	56431.16248965721
  "If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs	2.653159252896484e+18
 Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for	3.641944273793455e+21
"  In a few days Mr	7378092.829890779
 Bingley returned Mr	7808.427250621173
 Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library	32272598278669.457
 He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father	1.07834157372866e+29
 The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse	7.26231557413803e+29
  An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs	29300373590359.812
 Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all	1.539309947661654e+21
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c	1.5718047244394757e+24
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be	2.430363068814023e+46
 Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr	7.993404159997763e+33
 Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	378616053529117.06
 The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin	3.944577525162577e+41
 And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr	2.554198842224937e+17
 Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man	4.9228442449480696e+16
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners	2.4220324435746796e+18
 His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion	2982352026243.617
 His brother-in-law, Mr	90082.53035110648
 Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr	447239879656.02155
 Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year	2.483057336230772e+42
 The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr	1.8583902240183192e+22
 Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend	2.620059780804895e+77
 Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield	2.5929940501681847e+41
 Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves	40187510.39376926
 What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr	45823856506.671524
 Darcy danced only once with Mrs	5374054.630556131
 Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party	7.252533529892298e+35
 His character was decided	72748.7349058277
 Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs	454125353.8293201
 Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters	1.5794873990280465e+23
 Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr	2.517766157024055e+16
 Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it	2.8072338975232508e+19
  "Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance	7955998530252967.0
 I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner	26700791947754.41
 You had much better dance	667339.2740446535
"  "I certainly shall not	8345551.688542172
 At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable	467248564540.3734
 Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with	1.6339777840666705e+28
"  "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty	2.812140221954318e+52
"  "_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr	4.020132310104349e+19
 Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet	609843296.2450259
  "Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very agreeable	4.6970132441108475e+37
 Do let me ask my partner to introduce you	3874043816.620044
"  "Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, "She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men	6.815842915602143e+66
 You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me	2.589555036753817e+20
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Bingley followed his advice	64595.93784960651
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous	8.037768172742976e+26
  The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family	35011966597.65976
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party	2921359758759.7075
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters	3643798858113554.5
 Jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way	4.2961817703933395e+19
 Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure	64186.44584064682
 Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball	2.5244758168462698e+44
 They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants	1.8152712221247816e+23
 They found Mr	8293.516406537909
 Bennet still up	7557.758485291361
 With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations	6.237082229805127e+33
 He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear	6.903509794858765e+28
  "Oh! my dear Mr	6788433.089010431
 Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball	3.038649685592743e+22
 I wish you had been there	7592962.843197267
 Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it	53866551187.05668
 Every body said how well she looked; and Mr	47610682868.44851
 Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice	429158504771.91
 Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time	1.113684771263231e+31
 First of all, he asked Miss Lucas	629913186.6885724
 So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next	4.118490257664881e+19
 Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"  "If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners	9.689963766812458e+78
 Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"  "Oh! my dear," continued Mrs	3.113807259477699e+23
 Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him	6578318194.775934
 He is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women	2876497478110.326
 I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses	32303339215532.004
 I dare say the lace upon Mrs	65169344.73931128
 Hurst's gown----"  Here she was interrupted again	3661475674885.5513
 Bennet protested against any description of finery	39787385.14904067
 She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr	1.5058788720369512e+29
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
  "But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing	7.705811541274741e+40
 So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs	2.9171049223571623e+52
 I quite detest the man	664008.3090633939
"     CHAPTER IV	7624.360156071657
   When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr	3.5853726510171754e+19
 Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him	40189437257807.11
  "He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"  "He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can	1.7163000601633354e+64
 His character is thereby complete	542295.6888794887
"  "I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time	3.1384798968860692e+16
 I did not expect such a compliment	61323655.80916484
"  "Did not you? _I_ did for you	6984236565988.387
 But that is one great difference between us	445659467.483
 Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never	362060019398429.5
 What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room	5.404974027703408e+30
 No thanks to his gallantry for that	61954628.89603545
 Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him	4.538489573455074e+16
 You have liked many a stupider person	62765355.04621536
"  "Dear Lizzy!"  "Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general	2.2720947336954414e+24
 All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes	47417720770.48339
 I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	32077560600005.695
"  "I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think	3.2360943046047113e+21
"  "I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder	4.6942223545474624e+17
 With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where	6.151219149885811e+29
 But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone	2.2764863738258404e+30
 And so, you like this man's sisters too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his	2.784825662882087e+20
"  "Certainly not; at first	75706332.40764457
 But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them	330653607207.1023
 Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her	9.642910435749312e+28
"  Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them	1.5220152424791914e+59
 They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others	1.411168013921693e+61
 They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade	3.549832092340506e+32
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it	6.916300953182575e+30
--Mr	8733.391073594365
 Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase	8.82910167711501e+64
  His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs	5.893111930755561e+40
 Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her	1.0822005958002268e+26
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House	1.220611301249218e+22
 He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately	7.456538095176111e+36
  Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character	2.3705259713557225e+19
--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied	8.031836184509671e+38
 On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion	2.1378937403147166e+19
 In understanding Darcy was the superior	6765848.440609375
 Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever	419817562115.7159
 He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting	2.422174843205258e+24
 In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	4909437830.328006
 Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence	1972635226827963.5
  The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic	40538729320029.375
 Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful	9.359026985835061e+56
 Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure	3.661224689565094e+40
 Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much	40256463557232.43
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of	1.1643649018065698e+37
 Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose	1.1382800950278182e+25
     CHAPTER V	742.8485262911339
   Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate	1.6775619974957002e+16
 It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world	5.103646659731679e+70
 For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body	2.3612949725859647e+25
 By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St	3869247039833.518
 James's had made him courteous	716458.1262751858
 Bennet	101.78305820814953
--They had several children	5679696.458558751
  That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate	5.733605124141186e+34
  "_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs	580341187177187.0
 Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas	64146981.13674384
 "_You_ were Mr	8568681.049976088
 Bingley's first choice	6600.671773911355
"  "Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better	59326685015.21599
"  "Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice	60745026458847.805
 To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something about Mr	1.1012665914548335e+29
 Robinson	86.61950045400464
"  "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr	4434586023047.167
 Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr	528535603203.555
 Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point	1.4341594480133456e+60
"  "Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know	2.831901432466796e+25
"  "_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said Charlotte	3.5654913482913365e+21
 "Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_	2.387318324594284e+21
"  "I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him	6.397587305239631e+37
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	1.0004084571417634e+20
"  "Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said Jane	4.180742419943971e+17
"  "Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance	1.995239833943294e+22
 With _them_ he is remarkably agreeable	509340910.796071
"  "I do not believe a word of it, my dear	66863077834983.99
 Long	96.05076188670454
 But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs	8.139568756897906e+28
 Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise	3.882058160550581e+17
 Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza	4.057229444304446e+16
"  "His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it	1.297408619042187e+31
 One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself	1.4996419646840357e+27
"  "That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_	2.0036031137809997e+30
"  "Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing I believe	2.6781501963268787e+26
 By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary	2.3835965839184574e+54
 Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously	280007535698323.16
 A person may be proud without being vain	390097796.42199165
 Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us	1.8855901612344058e+19
"  "If I were as rich as Mr	6843100655.1283
 I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day	2.9454668618257252e+16
"  "Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs	3.274231070917689e+17
 Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly	2.715994985653044e+19
"  The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit	2.0410520830778e+25
     CHAPTER VI	742.6610242200244
   The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield	41877999853.049164
 The visit was returned in due form	51212844.556219086
 Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs	307719517635.64435
 Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the two eldest	5.457733521772826e+39
 By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration	8.815429330866435e+59
 It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent	inf
 She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas	557638491.6165692
  "It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded	9.919436089108934e+35
 If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark	6.077194104230178e+40
 There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself	1.6563265547752138e+23
 We can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement	4.1802775713552433e+30
 In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels	1.4035274046373593e+19
 Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on	1.2850566992195947e+23
"  "But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow	3.870138785283315e+16
 If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too	2.0479632474265402e+22
"  "Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do	3.872494191458143e+16
"  "But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out	2.5839851225898543e+25
"  "Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her	5801922045171.749
 But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together	2.3017699725043487e+40
 Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention	2.070241830157249e+17
 When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses	2.161169440233494e+20
"  "Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it	3.659387670362813e+48
 But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design	28803711956225.19
 As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness	3.530094628533509e+20
 She has known him only a fortnight	56251027.49586614
 She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times	5.745144000834279e+28
 This is not quite enough to make her understand his character	430937779993.93823
"  "Not as you represent it	81429766.8681896
 Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal	1.7968290375590695e+39
"  "Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth	5.359956822095045e+50
 Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance	4133453790.5129714
 If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least	1.2569408819930468e+30
 They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life	3.278069134331039e+38
"  "You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound	460807282024421.75
 You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself	3.3381058176476205e+17
"  Occupied in observing Mr	675472.3838179283
 Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend	1.2911901354959304e+27
 Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise	9.184328179190454e+34
 But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes	2.417181316473648e+41
 To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying	314448904.97831744
 Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness	1.818738742385006e+55
 Of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with	1.5534619111550017e+30
 His doing so drew her notice	5590466.67426403
 It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled	26724488362850.777
  "What does Mr	83826.41083354646
 Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"  "That is a question which Mr	2.275883684877366e+27
"  "But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about	2.0883713613865125e+22
 He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him	1.5476204071416874e+25
"  On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,  "Did not you think, Mr	5.371208474272156e+52
 Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?"  "With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic	4.454450888926527e+39
"  "You are severe on us	66113471.5385526
"  "It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas	3.9754376173596836e+18
 "I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows	3.974224852233044e+16
"  "You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers	8.680243688107988e+63
" On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must	4.509643996739614e+23
" And gravely glancing at Mr	6087154.736067037
 Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I shall keep mine to swell my song	5.756146014236228e+32
"  Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital	407368865005.4451
 After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display	7.748849433542247e+59
  Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached	2.0691173233692047e+39
 Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room	6.273396924671709e+73
 Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began	1.2660676226052116e+46
  "What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr	4140613497143.8096
 Darcy!--There is nothing like dancing after all	53943456.39681096
"  "Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world	4.250871218553866e+22
--Every savage can dance	6199266.493927725
"  Sir William only smiled	590937.8961299468
 "Your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr	1.6288679408172788e+33
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
"  "You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir	53683685780517.62
"  "Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight	580803435009195.2
 Do you often dance at St	5167369.084640435
 James's?"  "Never, sir	72502276.27465877
"  "Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"  "It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it	1.2108950265692745e+34
"  "You have a house in town, I conclude?"  Mr	600270275702511.1
  "I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas	4.526583998014623e+34
 Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner	2.8430271777951416e+18
--You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you	2.6831622401664127e+19
" And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr	59218902763534.39
 Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,  "Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing	8.462909410900649e+42
--I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner	1.9229550420535725e+20
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain	2.1136863230608224e+17
 Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion	1.4042025530106534e+18
  "You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour	4.0806245245880006e+51
"  "Mr	10876.835996291326
 Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling	62021424013.43497
 Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,  "I can guess the subject of your reverie	1.0702110860827703e+36
"  "I should imagine not	8301891.539762607
"  "You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion	1.109380784016426e+28
 I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"  "Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you	8.473297602783973e+43
 My mind was more agreeably engaged	4781045.31472946
 I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	1.0237700180402748e+24
"  Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections	1.3628740366173007e+26
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy replied with great intrepidity,  "Miss Elizabeth Bennet	67576063110.21613
"  "Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley	55430758982.112885
 "I am all astonishment	775416.3612666895
 How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you joy?"  "That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask	1.2361078521969348e+30
 A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment	1.8524639542180347e+21
 I knew you would be wishing me joy	486215029.3938784
"  "Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled	2.4708500105290518e+20
 You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you	3.223968954846196e+20
"  He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long	1.0373309210323566e+34
     CHAPTER VII	747.3324493257456
   Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his	1.2817839026327362e+54
 Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds	2.6661358227425556e+16
  She had a sister married to a Mr	750283186.498581
 Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade	1.8310854065104867e+30
  The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way	8.925849067161724e+46
 The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt	1.7531017765453171e+71
  Their visits to Mrs	74134.98068341387
 Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence	4704282279.519171
 Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections	231592979763560.6
 Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves	2.1955934111244099e+18
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before	2.0261830099912035e+17
 They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr	53223497844.43015
 Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign	1.2127106867476659e+27
 Bennet coolly observed,  "From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country	1.6905602201181824e+28
"  Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London	6.912690991878636e+47
  "I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs	682753290804.821
 Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly	3667104736266587.0
 If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however	3.2245663988662047e+19
"  "If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it	3.319945715452792e+16
"  "Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever	532491618883941.0
"  "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree	3.673579744493337e+18
 I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish	8.969746761283717e+27
"  "My dear Mr	886730.7068280609
 Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother	3.9589803583492525e+17
--When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do	1.1272589737733323e+22
 I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals	1.2906909256096508e+67
"  "Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library	2.4110296133274925e+43
"  Mrs	1017.6641180120203
 Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer	1.1102582713025074e+29
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,  "Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love	2.2313218802021268e+52
"  "It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud	4.968786927835768e+17
       "My dear Friend,       "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and      me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our      lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never      end without a quarrel	1.0688897418826759e+50
 Come as soon as you can on the receipt of      this	494955262075.5829
 My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers	485491583556.761
      Yours ever,       "CAROLINE BINGLEY	6349075.922350997
"  "With the officers!" cried Lydia	6547035738.601646
 "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_	43591122982191.92
"  "Dining out," said Mrs	725754202.3616
 Bennet, "that is very unlucky	78997295.5724947
"  "Can I have the carriage?" said Jane	645985538658.2756
  "No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night	1.916197995388502e+27
"  "That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home	2.833758476235128e+27
"  "Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr	60239499057.44332
 Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs	3544892961903463.5
"  "I had much rather go in the coach	60052074076.133415
 They are wanted in the farm, Mr	645261452.2940276
 Bennet, are not they?"  "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them	2.1434938041993955e+21
"  "But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered	2.7968077050008033e+21
"  She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged	2.902734633241919e+16
 Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard	2690429982739767.5
 Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted	4628487726718.006
 The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back	1805202959132816.2
  "This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs	418018059054918.6
 Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own	3.19329581828952e+18
 Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:       "My dearest Lizzy,       "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be      imputed to my getting wet through yesterday	2.613508798083088e+44
 My kind friends will      not hear of my returning home till I am better	226063539740140.6
 They insist also on      my seeing Mr	46172704.9887175
 Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear      of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache      there is not much the matter with me	2.196595748401765e+28
       "Yours, &c	662908.9739843328
"  "Well, my dear," said Mr	91745994924.62006
 Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr	8.162672231242755e+41
 Bingley, and under your orders	6853620.08245524
"  "Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying	44328302946989.72
 People do not die of little trifling colds	466536901.85944235
 She will be taken good care of	59604630.520374075
 As long as she stays there, it is all very well	6580636073272.229
 I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage	61470224252940.41
 She declared her resolution	71806.96151492612
  "How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there	1.2298989860970183e+39
"  "I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want	477426836964343.44
"  "Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?"  "No, indeed	4.231262088845742e+28
 I do not wish to avoid the walk	603995290.8457036
 The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles	303744632951283.56
 I shall be back by dinner	6033782.421996615
"  "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required	4.727999439631832e+41
--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together	2343971205292796.5
  "If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes	9.473057676891464e+26
"  In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise	4.403451562700236e+73
  She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise	1.694187198062538e+24
--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs	1.2717879700909367e+29
 Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it	3.24700909600816e+17
 She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness	9.384318524572898e+28
--Mr	8733.391073594365
 Darcy said very little, and Mr	80889314.27945541
 Hurst nothing at all	70738.98261491623
 The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone	1.2344588778378398e+29
 The latter was thinking only of his breakfast	556234006.4718779
  Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	35680307622.60497
 Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room	3.187750200414655e+21
 Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance	2.6778515510230494e+45
 She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with	1.0126554366940605e+34
 Elizabeth silently attended her	67545.9134767864
  When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane	7.952840472171887e+31
 The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts	5.259214946675461e+48
 The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely	2.416702907265891e+17
 Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere	7.918123555486735e+30
  When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so	3.0550676895746673e+18
 Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present	1.873501143610939e+49
 Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes	1.4479490839872268e+27
     CHAPTER VIII	753.1610575185248
   At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner	1.2351863848915673e+20
 To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr	2.2510318954802904e+24
 Jane was by no means better	6112228.536640446
 The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike	2.4684144926826323e+65
  Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency	3.0560429659231564e+19
 His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others	9.941378802059544e+33
 She had very little notice from any but him	5116424403.518307
 Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr	6080395.957834953
 Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr	5590061644728.034
 Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her	6.7886403662268426e+44
  When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	1.9513215069160166e+26
 Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty	1.1279671576876674e+30
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Hurst thought the same, and added,  "She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker	2.7612489099754494e+25
 I shall never forget her appearance this morning	458364679.4167852
 She really looked almost wild	535682.2942780262
"  "She did indeed, Louisa	77846135.88647152
 I could hardly keep my countenance	5376687.934330943
 Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"  "Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office	6.162936460733783e+73
 I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning	2.3722041491310403e+17
 Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice	34265178.30435898
 Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition	1.3400075936074982e+33
"  "Certainly not	95019.674820322
"  "To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum	5.820089725800877e+57
"  "It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley	3.628853364038366e+17
  "I am afraid, Mr	8686059.057404384
 Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes	1.539544038610435e+25
"  "Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise	6.192563570612878e+17
"--A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs	4135468193057.388
 Hurst began again	6768.957045007767
  "I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled	1.266600618895874e+29
 But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it	2.6587137366042698e+22
"  "I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton	3.3307001148585134e+18
"  "Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside	293383178651447.2
"  "That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily	4.024096090693807e+16
  "If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable	1.9373553749767285e+27
"  "But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy	1.698057505268354e+23
  To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations	3.654883164841369e+32
  With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee	1.5062771304533798e+26
 She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself	4.714427746750208e+47
 On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book	9.002429890283125e+52
 Hurst looked at her with astonishment	5825964.192668718
  "Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular	3.402750363689269e+17
"  "Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards	589873905492232.2
 She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else	3382554036696.9023
"  "I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things	1.1276584112579684e+32
"  Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying	1.991708792968248e+20
 He immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded	26821359514645.645
  "And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into	5.101677338012363e+37
"  Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room	3227111206169730.5
  "I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books	2.2178927191817768e+23
--What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr	4407103445983.141
 Darcy!"  "It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations	3.6261037717134284e+23
"  "I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these	3.049216832190213e+16
 Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley	2.7393467542116385e+20
"  "I wish it may	8630547.268529223
"  "But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model	1.9103573677958842e+24
 There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire	32569213152.288906
"  "With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it	2.912066295783424e+17
"  "I am talking of possibilities, Charles	8077777796.565911
"  "Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation	2.1435052582662727e+22
"  Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr	5.670823410270741e+38
 Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game	54414660546.417885
  "Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will she be as tall as I am?"  "I think she will	1.2959641486872506e+31
 She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller	3732541977844.6396
"  "How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much	2.086744688269397e+20
 Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite	1.6318128615934822e+22
"  "It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are	2.879526721803215e+29
"  "All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"  "Yes, all of them, I think	2.2534952556836882e+26
 I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished	6.2865438544892565e+35
"  "Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth	2.8877552028776874e+20
 The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen	2.017577435223539e+23
 But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general	2.6166612849817396e+16
 I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished	1.4028794518869871e+23
"  "Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley	70709216779618.5
  "Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman	2.596365771745074e+21
"  "Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it	4870415593498.873
"  "Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with	9.743316193859908e+30
 A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved	1.5733158349735089e+63
"  "I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women	1.8825313630057236e+16
"  "Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?"  "_I_ never saw such a woman	1.4676157745018382e+30
"  Mrs	1017.6641180120203
 Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr	4.4455582181814153e+30
 Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward	1.7678314005881578e+17
 As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room	2778582554342336.5
  "Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds	5.481321449420812e+49
 But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art	4.722186141466765e+16
"  "Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation	1.3767139312148512e+34
 Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable	57964221.27626725
"  Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject	2.880827650953377e+16
  Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her	3.1543514741357314e+20
 Bingley urged Mr	7385.946823732993
 Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians	6.107050002535628e+32
 This, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr	2.0298965228545195e+27
 Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better	2.063903002166878e+17
 Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable	2957114251062.736
 They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	2.6761847917670742e+41
     CHAPTER IX	741.3199562126512
 Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters	1.6732191374930717e+19
 In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation	1.0533290625798044e+33
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast	2.2019590422700684e+16
  Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs	46805404920.19452
 Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield	3.2728900647354936e+39
 She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable	5.805377084314827e+30
 After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour	9.467794750835202e+26
 Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs	52456688.75850286
 Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected	39544532828.41621
  "Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer	841804605698.9758
 "She is a great deal too ill to be moved	451362567675.8793
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Jones says we must not think of moving her	3886433311.913711
 We must trespass a little longer on your kindness	3561973545.827152
"  "Removed!" cried Bingley	67315372.28445551
 "It must not be thought of	84343194.06863935
 My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal	51095808201925.586
"  "You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us	8.993451058434325e+32
"  Mrs	1017.6641180120203
 Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments	7982044.98211116
  "I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with	2.651761942421811e+71
 I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_	38650922094944.805
 You have a sweet room here, Mr	628362113.2726016
 Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk	41470237006.87177
 You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease	3.56375517620861e+20
"  "Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes	9.710454336158303e+33
"  "That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth	5.635114860528776e+16
  "Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly	62665051.324430935
"  "I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful	1.4601216155356452e+24
"  "That is as it happens	80383926.6441106
 It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	1.256195319338701e+22
"  "I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character	5.286454258380427e+21
 It must be an amusing study	5193989.584256297
"  "The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study	2.7251793930540826e+21
 In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society	36737118254068.86
"  "But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever	2.704223583232521e+21
"  "Yes, indeed," cried Mrs	8337304624.294398
 Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood	397602837259.94464
 "I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town	2.951972975077864e+21
"  Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away	2.5355261840486954e+20
 Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph	2.9859127868793044e+16
 The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr	46005494133250.1
 Bingley?"  "When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same	1.943313765128368e+35
 They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either	341121734055132.7
 But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all	4.05741322213724e+19
"  "Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother	6.401836450690977e+18
 "You quite mistook Mr	924408.7112312736
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
"  "Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger	1.2894971701009782e+31
 I know we dine with four and twenty families	3743062062.2701936
"  Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance	42063989826553.086
 His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr	3612208692980.326
 Darcy with a very expressive smile	5730829.821208653
  "Yes, she called yesterday with her father	5984444818.223865
 What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr	4744555602.8655615
 Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every body	1.836138289593903e+24
--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter	4.289472682052051e+29
"  "Did Charlotte dine with you?"  "No, she would go home	4.665138258528199e+16
 I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies	6800031939.318114
 For my part, Mr	857230.1502986902
 Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently	1.018056131590353e+23
 It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend	1.2524906664135227e+27
"  "She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley	47335153845361.61
 Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty	26376390953175.348
 I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body better looking	1.6020140917373099e+25
 I do not trust my own partiality	50753182.682877004
 But however he did not	761231.1860261566
 Perhaps he thought her too young	5950294.273249784
 However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were	534186400554152.4
 "There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way	3.973532673131646e+16
 I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"  "I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy	9.781344852756721e+33
  "Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may	692191546117.0775
 Every thing nourishes what is strong already	51243133.52211245
 But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away	1.6560281720238673e+25
"  Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again	1.5517162587873159e+22
 She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs	3.073408812544417e+19
 Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr	53489012.26313183
 Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy	3.527498153708416e+16
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs	477173519661.4901
 Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage	47179150558.51428
 Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward	3361962909508.5957
 The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr	1.5494992774950555e+27
 Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield	2.0688976509809674e+17
  Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age	4.202276765470175e+34
 She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance	5.510311003810722e+37
 She was very equal therefore to address Mr	554735701.2302709
 Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it	9.812316344561196e+34
 His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear	3549719115816.0034
  "I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball	1.081714138188361e+34
 But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill	4381943814645.9185
"  Lydia declared herself satisfied	584355.4840546966
 "Oh! yes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again	9.640684022824265e+27
 And when you have given _your_ ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also	2.1451051228869408e+23
 I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	2508686181881965.5
 Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr	1.7285887966642416e+31
 Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_	1.0474929112644898e+36
     CHAPTER X	741.1941090933697
   The day passed much as the day before had done	48857285029.1877
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room	1.1234772125319683e+35
 The loo table, however, did not appear	5807036986.874323
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister	1.446573522563965e+31
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Hurst and Mr	8946.121875857236
 Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs	91260683.63616684
 Hurst was observing their game	524111.27243771456
  Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion	2.0213048687145376e+20
 The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each	7.071134475384211e+52
  "How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"  He made no answer	2.5136309952407603e+18
  "You write uncommonly fast	590074.1721978843
"  "You are mistaken	849031.8054196802
 I write rather slowly	60745.5025982004
"  "Pray tell your sister that I long to see her	5002717552707.657
"  "I have already told her so once, by your desire	46779100591913.08
"  "I am afraid you do not like your pen	444169524093.4421
 Let me mend it for you	6249299.846646091
 I mend pens remarkably well	638333.144120984
"  "Thank you--but I always mend my own	4042581808.929307
"  "How can you contrive to write so even?"  He was silent	3622817621387766.0
  "Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's	4.448585620925117e+44
"  "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At present I have not room to do them justice	1.4599086063970123e+24
"  "Oh! it is of no consequence	6692317004.515718
 But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr	38669310984426.875
"  "That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease	2.8180432502014113e+26
 He studies too much for words of four syllables	5962645887.49537
--Do not you, Darcy?"  "My style of writing is very different from yours	2.551632588873622e+19
"  "Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable	3.7627562879626045e+18
 He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest	493284620996.3943
"  "My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents	8.179738347241492e+27
"  "Your humility, Mr	8653753.127750566
 Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof	81584282518.97241
"  "Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility	4.4671732060784083e+17
 It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast	29600663691851.188
"  "And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"  "The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting	6.334344206732855e+59
 The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance	1.7478300222822143e+27
 When you told Mrs	75381.98056903546
 Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"  "Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning	inf
 And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment	2.9236917127329734e+25
 At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	1.6418981926692937e+21
"  "I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity	2.30158105189561e+24
 Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month	1.2129305205305647e+64
"  "You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr	6.5647403480340344e+16
 Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition	4709481504.63681
"  "I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper	1.5028912911575161e+28
 But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could	1.9528391521654843e+49
"  "Would Mr	101299.03763782854
 Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"  "Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for himself	5.742052916065624e+36
"  "You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged	1.993357141656155e+22
 Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety	1.6039645302887718e+56
"  "To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you	4.083271419883604e+17
"  "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either	364147568233612.8
"  "You appear to me, Mr	942355766.918507
 Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection	4818565331969.649
 A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it	1.2633540120465288e+24
 I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr	3153701885313807.5
 Bingley	99.51115896130685
 But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"  "Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"  "By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of	inf
 I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference	1.0312508042365827e+28
 I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do	5.9370142920300585e+38
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh	1.5629714826160374e+20
 Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense	1.6472558791386e+20
--"You dislike an argument, and want to silence this	42620053496581.17
"  "Perhaps I do	890649.2678784585
 Arguments are too much like disputes	5528641.735931624
 If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me	9.240126325740312e+31
"  "What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr	4.510558996901879e+20
 Darcy had much better finish his letter	50043143.57372622
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter	47429625060.80965
  When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music	2.8123058871892062e+19
 Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself	7.328570447431253e+33
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr	4.36387430465377e+32
 Darcy's eyes were fixed on her	5356778.511199986
 She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange	5.993540880439451e+36
 She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present	4.636232198322973e+37
 The supposition did not pain her	6490670.84691266
 She liked him too little to care for his approbation	42361144624.55268
  After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr	1.3490579510830456e+21
 Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her--  "Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"  She smiled, but made no answer	8.662824151963179e+40
 He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence	443075538633.73334
  "Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply	2.595248023316855e+24
 You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt	6.59141828499691e+42
 I have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare	8.616510482029005e+27
"  Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her	2.7948542916045965e+52
 He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger	3.0698055705441337e+21
  Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth	4.722073958286092e+34
  She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance	1.069252398928959e+26
  "I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers	1.5361908122921775e+62
"  "Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"  "Oh! yes	2.0804994793151717e+19
--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley	1.625639399839076e+19
 Put them next to your great uncle the judge	4071667240.900002
 They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines	356320265437602.1
"  At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs	38576055879685.83
 Hurst and Elizabeth herself	80516.38977851802
  "You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs	44702096360.501114
 Hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out	278660714750573.38
"  Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr	496502844.0625411
 The path just admitted three	514525.28715693596
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,--  "This walk is not wide enough for our party	1.5245967965536462e+20
 We had better go into the avenue	65307474.26376809
--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage	5716773485110.317
 The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth	5963014040.951033
 Good bye	765.4992683328314
"  She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two	2.146874889696989e+26
     CHAPTER XI	744.2447302579417
 They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit	1.3514369096314454e+21
  But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object	39809510261960.88
 Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps	1.2597198729591985e+23
 Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation	1.3351975470182433e+25
 He was full of joy and attention	61230598.04535496
 The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door	5.501747673896062e+43
 He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else	365706218036637.44
 Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight	4705261933720943.0
  When tea was over, Mr	7125019.031662983
 Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain	6594851502.136246
 She had obtained private intelligence that Mr	48982896.24363718
 Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected	389436374.72614485
 She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her	2.309809420819738e+25
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep	3.129129490699881e+20
 Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs	339165048132112.44
 Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet	2.1321401064459318e+23
  Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr	323779461734.1958
 Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page	7.173507568452039e+27
 She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on	3.7150409783891345e+21
"  No one made any reply	6251352.165752611
 She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,  "By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure	inf
"  "If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards	1.934762687881825e+53
"  "I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting	1.0340253858715812e+38
 It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day	1.7327107512725583e+18
"  "Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball	1.9526319015686217e+25
"  Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room	2.2671568705643e+17
 Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious	5.069123577987779e+22
 In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said,  "Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room	9.133193981837323e+41
--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude	2.796294762256626e+16
"  Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately	63908693518.0865
 Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr	306968777014353.44
 Darcy looked up	7519.3766680956105
 He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere	3.197297553004929e+44
 "What could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?  "Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it	1.8519937919943103e+64
 Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives	3.265830383740635e+16
  "I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak	3.047945044853611e+23
 "You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire	7.910455729721125e+63
"  "Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley	46089985237.60249
 "I never heard any thing so abominable	508648015.1246462
 How shall we punish him for such a speech?"  "Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth	1.9110325535321528e+26
 "We can all plague and punish one another	4045513445.156252
 Teaze him--laugh at him	76598.65244572097
"  "But upon my honour I do _not_	549498470445.37274
 I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_	2752223775649027.5
 Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no--I feel he may defy us there	1.2938024607962289e+18
 And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject	2.0191229114702363e+22
 Darcy may hug himself	79368.94827137819
"  "Mr	10876.835996291326
 Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth	522811341108.50757
 "That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance	1.232808139390259e+31
 I dearly love a laugh	607478.2928122418
"  "Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be	3.884763983038167e+19
 The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke	6.63545150147401e+32
"  "Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of _them_	4.0874476070134585e+22
 I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good	34919286151.71582
 Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can	2.065440006622667e+24
--But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without	527354275891272.6
"  "Perhaps that is not possible for any one	58142057807.43974
"  "Such as vanity and pride	73747436.01130556
"  "Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed	5666858185.413575
 But pride--where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation	3.6235377963154944e+17
"  Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	520230447.797277
  "Your examination of Mr	778516.9841729358
 Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"  "I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr	1.959919549025995e+27
 Darcy has no defect	66423.12141490958
"  "No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension	6866442735217.242
 I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding	5393355777565647.0
 My temper I dare not vouch for	48380960.20038159
--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world	3.2335603540581395e+17
 I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself	1.9397547587270004e+20
 My temper would perhaps be called resentful	41458113.835278735
--My good opinion once lost is lost for ever	286120052834.5987
 "Implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character	676296119677.2642
 But you have chosen your fault well	48244229.92582106
--I really cannot _laugh_ at it	43931754660.211815
 You are safe from me	656894.3489888272
"  "There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome	1.1151749357168997e+30
"  "And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body	458024200309121.8
"  "And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them	4.4402702916675666e+18
"  "Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share	2.7009397265182543e+22
 Hurst	92.09469146175697
"  Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it	1.904721962314344e+29
 He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention	3376968592489.71
     CHAPTER XII	731.6204861599343
   In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day	1.1981697080151127e+34
 But Mrs	935.8805876274682
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr	1.4276308140307894e+26
 Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well	2.7352980942387504e+16
--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr	3.541711965147833e+42
  The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred	3.5775392213855066e+36
 Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other	1.1241790685043987e+27
  The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right	2.2159840781189632e+48
  To Mr	1082.6013904328236
 Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough	419451224745.2137
 He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it	9.702604034617944e+55
 Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her	3.807046073706087e+47
 Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former	8.284153429988524e+56
--Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits	32876782348904.676
  They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	32095585248.601795
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again	1.0759247616219002e+26
 The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth	1.6092494521870086e+30
 Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort	416950664466.0527
 Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married	2.938821302045589e+48
     CHAPTER XIII	751.6447326448438
   "I hope, my dear," said Mr	86199432970.00746
 Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party	7.078267378542526e+35
"  "Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her	4.7344491017332804e+41
 I do not believe she often sees such at home	40450829378.40391
"  "The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger	5322757054927876.0
" Mrs	1017.6641180120203
 Bennet's eyes sparkled	6035.600973508879
--"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr	5079781682890.167
 Bingley I am sure	76314.63590526389
 Bingley	99.51115896130685
--But--good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day	1.5911579796517022e+19
 Lydia, my love, ring the bell	589649001.5003006
 I must speak to Hill, this moment	624302133.7365953
"  "It is _not_ Mr	856770998.6289129
 Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life	2.6055382802364676e+23
"  This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	1.2038893182468449e+24
  After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained	2640451541151.0747
 "About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention	7.954871933983118e+32
 It is from my cousin, Mr	74940499.991584
 Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases	2.273205271415861e+22
"  "Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned	3.371930860615731e+20
 Pray do not talk of that odious man	459884309.2396563
 I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it	3.516904958787824e+46
"  Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail	413249671525202.9
 They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs	3945234317464133.5
 Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	2.3932700825988285e+38
  "It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr	6271779464054.766
 Bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr	707262033.2880106
 Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn	65532707.59204498
 But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself	1.8950800369544063e+22
"  "No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical	2.939672663413748e+31
 I hate such false friends	544832.413751087
 Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?"  "Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear	5.907748901181064e+39
"       _Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,       15th October	873159393224.9159
--"There, Mrs	8782737.747358507
 Bennet	101.78305820814953
 As a clergyman, moreover, I      feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in      all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds      I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly      commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the      entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,      and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch	1.7582866251728998e+77
 I cannot be      otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your      amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to      assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but      of this hereafter	4.4659562477892464e+41
 If you should have no objection to receive me      into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on      you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and      shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday      se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as      Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a      Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the      duty of the day	inf
 I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to      your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,       WILLIAM COLLINS	3.6716808347296853e+22
"  "At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said Mr	3.823642677405873e+18
 Bennet, as he folded up the letter	841376314.5411242
 "He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again	3.929830058849341e+42
"  "There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him	7.942110066445938e+34
"  "Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit	1.0633343551441026e+37
"  Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required	1.5393012668869813e+30
  "He must be an oddity, I think," said she	89389349997118.88
 "I cannot make him out	6825954.988722851
--There is something very pompous in his style	38148607253.79962
--And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could	2.086223098308816e+25
--Can he be a sensible man, sir?"  "No, my dear; I think not	3.5312167028728466e+21
 I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse	52107148302.281296
 There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well	3988183278649622.0
 I am impatient to see him	6643625.077503012
"  "In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem defective	4.4635627451707203e+18
 The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed	1.9091108668925104e+19
"  To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting	2.459433736844398e+17
 It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	5.040058753245987e+35
 As for their mother, Mr	8259111.153646835
 Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters	1.188898596290983e+29
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family	3.277093373067311e+17
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr	3.5251921047323176e+16
 Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself	251572383328706.62
 He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty	32901685108671.69
 His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal	36848001434610.44
 He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs	37630099920.14575
 Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	2.9464845120987983e+53
 This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs	5.458837761256539e+16
 Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,  "You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough	7.03876435072396e+42
 Things are settled so oddly	675662.4890852574
"  "You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate	654191626838.4915
"  "Ah! sir, I do indeed	6232081323.59887
 It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess	34525918676059.418
 Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world	1.8949223939267427e+23
 There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed	1989589048578904.0
"  "I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate	1.6377588297321203e+33
 But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them	307457754865074.44
 They were not the only objects of Mr	658812789.8350608
 Collins's admiration	746.8321451353535
 Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property	1.8996679620514194e+18
 The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing	1.1436778309343495e+29
 But here he was set right by Mrs	486271862.2105446
 Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen	2.693742168425106e+31
 He begged pardon for having displeased her	43773753.79983677
 In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour	1.0382505411278556e+24
     CHAPTER XIV	743.9554349255245
   During dinner, Mr	78268.68451505066
 Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness	2.6604014632888422e+47
 Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable	1.893874858888952e+18
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bennet could not have chosen better	5735320.352347856
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins was eloquent in her praise	6163577.477480728
 The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine	1.7112999196088432e+46
 She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her	2.9506364306703668e+23
 She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening	1.2696635431409973e+31
 Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her	1.4269327613203645e+24
 She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations	3.301949842099045e+46
 She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs	1.1902444103463697e+59
  "That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs	4.780462187437869e+16
 Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman	52961363356305.44
 It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her	330333979177335.25
 Does she live near you, sir?"  "The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence	4.691845929041033e+31
"  "I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?"  "She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property	1.7439042998624244e+36
"  "Ah!" cried Mrs	65579190.536866404
 Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls	3211673440316461.5
 And what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?"  "She is a most charming young lady indeed	1.8583645228342968e+23
 She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them	4.144499075767541e+45
 But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies	1.688777282141556e+21
"  "Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court	2.122700372237664e+18
"  "Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament	6.089128988782594e+36
 Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies	4.927153410108393e+30
 I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her	7.07337042139737e+38
--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay	7.524066759593958e+28
"  "You judge very properly," said Mr	63509271851.844154
 Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy	4.469715236562491e+18
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Bennet's expectations were fully answered	432543.2131790161
 His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure	2.887974142660497e+46
  By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr	796352100677.1327
 Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies	1.21279883943248e+28
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels	3.2419078885124976e+42
--Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed	42321167869.30551
--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons	2156110070133850.8
 Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,  "Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him	5.148978707858486e+53
 My aunt told me so herself on Saturday	420135899.5722924
 I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr	3.243471268999517e+17
 Denny comes back from town	466007.597248945
"  Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr	3.022874052960702e+16
 Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,  "I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit	4.0923528191155194e+36
 It amazes me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction	4.0347540141921444e+18
"  Then turning to Mr	792060.5414186084
 Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon	51927790248.097084
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements	1.4496523068716861e+20
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr	1.0095644622020289e+29
 Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr	4.829425623386197e+31
 Bennet, and prepared for backgammon	6863755.7556207385
     CHAPTER XV	736.8373587685448
 Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance	7.4591848695193e+64
 The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity	2.4290074300701693e+48
 A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility	6.683913757088874e+73
  His plan did not vary on seeing them	424064216.878486
--Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice	5.995355071425478e+34
 The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs	2.723290239449914e+20
 Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on	2.6539976251662106e+53
--"As to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged	3.20768775501981e+54
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while Mrs	4340754397149055.0
 Bennet was stirring the fire	827554.3463819589
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces	8.784578996977124e+38
  Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr	1.4628369551458715e+22
 Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr	603294636190.3301
 Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr	2.677364474253455e+22
 Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr	2.1877936054354052e+30
 Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford	61711126969287.7
 Such doings discomposed Mr	55837.13128314362
 Bennet exceedingly	829.598209198055
 In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr	2.3404052740520077e+56
 Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr	490503041070.8688
 Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go	8.251680992119747e+26
  In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton	1.9710453317372373e+23
 The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_	2.8004480755380694e+17
 Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them	3.211407365087371e+37
  But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way	6.098438382731216e+36
 The officer was the very Mr	8048382.909679533
 Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed	2.2302559008511478e+18
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr	282955349880852.06
 Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps	1.6301906391063802e+26
 This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming	1.5268401513597688e+20
 His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address	1.2024524802104606e+29
 The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street	5.448801110774541e+54
 On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities	1.7332674111689028e+21
 Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object	5651041630859.501
 He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her	3.749610577124664e+18
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting	2.3360911010196325e+56
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr	37923693187376.98
 Darcy just deigned to return	581269.5910292155
 What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know	3.569657096279751e+20
  In another minute Mr	69940.63827920634
 Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend	2.080130638239256e+19
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Denny and Mr	8674.796619872059
 Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr	528415302459.66376
 Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs	1.518030385336042e+28
 Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation	26509530465415.387
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr	1.1434008790134698e+61
 Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr	3.061029047100305e+36
 Collins by Jane's introduction of him	5779559.771316608
 She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice	1.0989634793912421e+52
 Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire	2.5941239363133654e+23
 She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr	3.049020316684006e+24
 Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows	3.117381249828779e+40
" Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr	1.7749842835098831e+25
 Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening	2.9064528862172287e+19
 This was agreed to, and Mrs	86965853.97662507
 Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards	5.746630732327186e+22
 Mr	103.65865118859166
  As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister	2.5673968033269934e+45
 Bennet by admiring Mrs	66768.6609259583
 Philips's manners and politeness	60402.684772318986
 He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before	2.768978155239445e+50
 Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life	9.638266823342735e+28
     CHAPTER XVI	749.1078607080937
   As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr	3.094431239612445e+17
 Collins's scruples of leaving Mr	551294.5553466375
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr	3.0602878092950793e+44
 Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house	40212805939110.87
  When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr	3792026166694443.0
 Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs	6.2476820664523045e+56
 Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room	1.3053737940180587e+60
  In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs	6.570444135468685e+46
 Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could	8.153444858527145e+32
 It was over at last however	6481344.29053199
 The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr	584148644.9376359
 Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration	8.936353998342103e+29
 The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr	1.3544545985419915e+32
 Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room	1.0727355977978615e+40
  Mr	103.65865118859166
  With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr	7253933792243.307
 Wickham and the officers, Mr	8906617.45587279
 Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs	6.634416679013442e+27
 Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	5.4137416894449656e+16
  When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist	1.4249406350455076e+22
  "I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs	1.6456624499661351e+37
 Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason	2896238249579393.5
 Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia	1.5303937497917565e+22
 Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr	62552556058.64384
 Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr	8.539880819096328e+40
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
 She dared not even mention that gentleman	48183533.4691194
 Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved	4874173.537285593
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Wickham began the subject himself	619421.4758753597
 He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr	1.8947427786738162e+24
 Darcy had been staying there	651633.661945265
  "About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand	1.4725115701928866e+35
"  "Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one	50748482052005.02
 A clear ten thousand per annum	3688732.719851661
"  Elizabeth could not but look surprised	63708909.35125423
  "You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday	1.2142214236345861e+31
--Are you much acquainted with Mr	564038727.8686473
 Darcy?"  "As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable	1.496642226326525e+34
"  "I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise	2.8449933560811527e+25
 I am not qualified to form one	56686997.89835213
 I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge	350853142326532.0
 But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else	1.3428385831930844e+22
--Here you are in your own family	4981876031.285877
"  "Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield	1.474458210871798e+25
 He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire	571692141.946645
 Every body is disgusted with his pride	49104790.2113709
 You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one	3374448768476.3945
"  "I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen	5.093406468412279e+44
 The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen	1.1378955661328792e+29
"  "I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man	3.6082194463067125e+20
" Wickham only shook his head	5658497.456376496
  "I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer	2.534469874577793e+27
"  "I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield	2.478540640320466e+24
 I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood	1.5229590036656927e+23
"  "Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr	3.881475667620137e+17
 If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go	3408698363704203.0
 We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is	1.8758690401604873e+54
 His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr	7670110486.903476
 Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr	3.021697396981884e+30
 Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections	2449647332099.0547
 His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father	6.1867374180679575e+34
"  Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry	1.600171929860512e+25
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry	4.768022799718448e+40
  "It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire	1.4309047988502648e+31
 Society, I own, is necessary to me	7343697138.510982
 I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude	332789523370980.75
 I _must_ have employment and society	560265342.3797183
 A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible	2.2757716011944906e+18
 The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now	4.2495951143602743e+43
"  "Indeed!"  "Yes--the late Mr	5576152233.664442
 Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift	47920541272282.87
 He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere	1.9515382486743973e+25
"  "Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?"  "There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law	6.71618270917245e+50
 A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr	46369230980756.06
 Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing	9.973155397505489e+35
 Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it	1.597098573206715e+55
 I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely	1.6790286619177412e+30
 But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me	3.0927830899243385e+19
"  "This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced	551712146564.2794
"  "Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_	3.5270844249102594e+19
 Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_	2.358620020668e+16
  "But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"  "A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy	4.1544744623147566e+46
 Had the late Mr	83793.57247267707
 Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life	7.445726255348746e+29
 He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me	1.7414015325247378e+23
"  "I had not thought Mr	88040515.70215446
 Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"  After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper	inf
 His disposition must be dreadful	616598.3466732026
"  "I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can hardly be just to him	2.961538375120246e+25
"  Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"  "We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care	inf
 _My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr	339207478658708.2
 Philips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr	2.1556526262594222e+22
 Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property	483349162405142.6
 He was most highly esteemed by Mr	52507069.36818899
 Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend	775740763.0534638
 Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, Mr	1.0423905955753232e+25
 Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself	1.0028326246893914e+36
"  "How strange!" cried Elizabeth	621152311.5210315
 "How abominable!--I wonder that the very pride of this Mr	606654403781.4199
 Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it	1.681592086747437e+29
"  "It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend	1.8038178633713536e+24
 It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling	265981719945.01154
 But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride	1.8809607430817488e+22
"  "Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"  "Yes	3.10220773192316e+18
 It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor	1.136342492101277e+28
 Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this	2.5869650464233927e+23
 Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive	2.0181415604411556e+28
 He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers	2.251459960374552e+43
"  "What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"  He shook his head	3.410547596318728e+16
--"I wish I could call her amiable	51410199326.93469
 It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy	46023599509.10572
 But she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud	554038049325.4678
--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement	1.6283764554650762e+28
 But she is nothing to me now	72220235.79778843
 She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished	2.3657459904730856e+16
 Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education	2.297456514494919e+22
"  After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,  "I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr	1.3298081809701932e+34
 Bingley! How can Mr	670482.7643749003
 Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other?--Do you know Mr	7.721100201181404e+34
 Bingley?"  "Not at all	79691169.16929491
"  "He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man	4723027906954.991
 He cannot know what Mr	681010.187360607
 Darcy is	957.8380114003535
"  "Probably not;--but Mr	917484.7647575929
 Darcy can please where he chuses	4712889.796981337
 He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while	32927161163370.53
 Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous	1.6575519534427286e+25
 His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure	1.6291778855043762e+31
 Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs	37804116629.66758
 Philips	91.94207022666426
--The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter	313497562812853.3
 It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs	3.0309272066842824e+16
 Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy	3.927341342320286e+41
  "I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object	4.4741931415256595e+44
 There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters	6.1811177938704816e+29
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr	4075970659.119402
 Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh	7.710411260077558e+25
 I hardly know how Mr	679466.2421276732
 Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long	3.185736320932584e+16
"  "You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr	1.2242540736235122e+27
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
"  "No, indeed, I did not	10170467789.334673
--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections	358621016074.4321
 I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday	372744702374.2543
"  "Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates	1.466471428497425e+30
"  This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley	382601448769399.94
 Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another	1.3176306960064927e+29
  "Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman	4.723262492822462e+52
"  "I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent	1.00037200582316e+46
 She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class	8.574655087564833e+57
"  Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr	2.759505278149722e+40
 Wickham's attentions	756.9606110095405
 There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs	53318010043.51779
 Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully	5082554324700858.0
 Elizabeth went away with her head full of him	4841235854.937227
 She could think of nothing but of Mr	756995096.06172
 Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr	1.230958088773238e+36
 Collins were once silent	62851.4371654903
 Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr	1.8866453611311685e+22
 Collins, in describing the civility of Mr	694209466.9081507
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House	2.434452192821384e+47
     CHAPTER XVII	754.9460276189992
   Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr	41091156986277.1
 Wickham and herself	8844.041384492706
 Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that Mr	41564576770826.78
 Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr	64964204.79488284
 Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham	1.6701279397697846e+26
--The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained	1.1136165103469444e+59
  "They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea	2.2101930034210177e+30
 Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other	3716788033.393406
 It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side	1.0892170579853469e+27
"  "Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody	3.606704000035461e+47
"  "Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion	2.9309281501766975e+19
 My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr	2262558050972920.5
 Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for	3.6153049984391787e+21
--It is impossible	718853.1902569125
 No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it	2.1127893818033588e+21
 Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? oh! no	2020332282943836.2
"  "I can much more easily believe Mr	5480919592.303794
 Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr	539871275.3589
 Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony	1.2406340118168444e+24
--If it be not so, let Mr	64800479145.08126
 Darcy contradict it	7793.997632637753
 Besides, there was truth in his looks	588244947.7651955
"  "It is difficult indeed--it is distressing	654117601.014256
--One does not know what to think	5282530111.1558485
"  But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr	4354689143350.469
 Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public	2.0164918591921736e+21
  The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr	7.873864152707666e+30
 Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday	1.0056604088682283e+25
 The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation	3.8661715245891385e+33
 To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs	36903354369613.695
 Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others	4.6903749956629684e+19
 They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs	4.147545479156497e+29
 Bennet's civilities	725.8505625252698
  The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family	3192690232620587.5
 Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr	1.3786471197474674e+24
 Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card	496559369.98816806
 Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr	1.2676165648639431e+34
 Darcy's looks and behaviour	65387.836470074326
 The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr	5.0452580411620294e+35
 Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball	1.9580457393857447e+25
 And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it	348025490978397.44
  "While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough	4.807170668053183e+18
--I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	27716616976958.22
 Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body	9.292530047397552e+25
"  Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr	2.7226090533187538e+20
 Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr	302314209920825.75
 Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance	1.5115742602503712e+60
  "I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her	inf
"  Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in	54211466.95747395
 She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr	2660888407811214.0
 There was no help for it however	63295838.29826745
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr	2749982242765403.5
 Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could	429554384841.65015
 She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more	3.0765621750674785e+18
--It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors	2.202978153998811e+45
 The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_	4.2940011403877034e+67
 Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply	1.203473048773859e+24
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him	2.8185247385533866e+19
  If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once	2.5378094156528243e+58
 Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr	1.1656540494530016e+23
 Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia	1.8618279125365405e+29
     CHAPTER XVIII	746.9247592033165
 Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	2.561787274544571e+21
 The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her	1.837009354712338e+21
 She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening	4.6304028714163084e+42
 But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr	2365651920550403.0
 Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,  "I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here	5.784192682584481e+64
"  This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make	1.771209470975121e+71
--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham	547204673646779.6
 She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr	1.1286131245382736e+32
 Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her	45393502.15808362
  But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice	1.433018575178163e+73
 The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification	2.3708586492318444e+18
 Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give	2.7168625278427893e+38
 The moment of her release from him was ecstacy	5201316751.766043
  She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked	2.1479891116345214e+24
 When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr	1.362679010976312e+26
  "I dare say you will find him very agreeable	45314437703.233406
"  "Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me such an evil	1.145905908023749e+28
"  When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence	2.4627163861673173e+51
 Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it	2313905782713555.5
 They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance	4.726370642287789e+61
 After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with  "It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr	1.435875572400319e+26
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
--_I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples	1.3785099186432582e+33
"  He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said	3.8014973443122195e+17
  "Very well	9312.403809707486
--That reply will do for the present	5282094051.306526
--Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones	9.786134683994956e+17
--But _now_ we may be silent	43134100387.84756
"  "Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"  "Sometimes	4.097745723684022e+17
 One must speak a little, you know	659831659.5708226
 It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible	4.352556841473188e+42
"  "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"  "Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds	3.504321989985884e+46
--We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb	1.4041215329298655e+42
"  "This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said he	3.130085581719523e+20
 "How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say	3.5573964703208044e+16
--_You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly	457875355739.99884
"  "I must not decide on my own performance	46123804892.11148
"  He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton	8.179103388266042e+34
 She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance	1.0785571141895914e+34
"  The effect was immediate	758129.8579261279
 At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,  "Mr	643638466245254.9
 Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain	5.521715559533847e+28
"  "He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life	1.330065675320223e+36
"  Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject	39104276778953.97
 At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr	8.207441568474829e+28
 Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner	2.4404532290627123e+18
  "I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir	3903612805247.142
 Such very superior dancing is not often seen	416454951.92243874
 It is evident that you belong to the first circles	61018360759.8303
 Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place	1.5539748891539244e+51
 What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr	350438834096.11597
 Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, Sir	627265975.8443679
--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me	1.4744681039713526e+26
"  The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together	1.5813863725158195e+44
 Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,  "Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	1.1546531474555924e+29
"  "I do not think we were speaking at all	546845989465.4474
--We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine	9.225137444999353e+23
"  "What think you of books?" said he, smiling	55985545135762.445
  "Books--Oh! no	97988.11276216083
--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings	3.0150651333464384e+17
--We may compare our different opinions	431026354.7356085
"  "No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else	1.965160875858666e+19
"  "The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he, with a look of doubt	4.6885082922841124e+23
  "Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr	5.883186009109034e+42
 Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable	4531461807267916.0
 You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created_	3957248741884159.5
"  "I am," said he, with a firm voice	71318907447127.16
  "And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"  "I hope not	3.3562401901513212e+16
"  "It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first	1.2850139599085364e+22
"  "May I ask to what these questions tend?"  "Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity	1.290434981510749e+33
"  "And what is your success?"  She shook her head	45641767399943.61
 "I do not get on at all	670324707.9894662
 I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly	320525710341.88293
"  "I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either	1.4296344557379719e+58
"  "But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity	2.735866471681048e+18
"  "I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied	3.8317365172126726e+17
 She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another	7.453141247565642e+53
  They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,  "So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr	inf
 Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr	6.737515345979845e+30
 Darcy in a most infamous manner	5995744.3935072115
 I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr	504525915225708.6
 His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it	1.8006134773562255e+25
 I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better	1.115319389782694e+27
"  "His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr	9.676346600467857e+38
 Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself	4.133414125775379e+18
"  "I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer	4.212432395080087e+17
 "Excuse my interference	68469.64869320775
--It was kindly meant	5890249.301709787
"  "Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself	56563795532.28263
--"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this	1.6696183421190832e+20
 I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr	3100700235010862.5
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley	2.554205440268371e+20
 Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening	7.2216817844095245e+31
--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness	5.682847254308084e+38
  "I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr	2.3480894333129868e+27
 Wickham	96.30085307271028
 But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon	1.072866064247149e+25
"  "No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you	4.012486695422843e+23
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr	1.7457118284105302e+22
 Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr	372921620.6457311
 Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr	2.4037711241996816e+23
 Darcy's regard	782.0475597605803
"  "Mr	10876.835996291326
 Bingley does not know Mr	685186.9980968266
"  "This account then is what he has received from Mr	4279468740372.9966
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
 I am perfectly satisfied	69054.6746927184
 But what does he say of the living?"  "He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr	1.3982261020302865e+26
 Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only	3.557715474381399e+18
"  "I have not a doubt of Mr	8544476389.871948
 Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only	1.6481073696835476e+20
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before	2.2889074957779545e+48
"  She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment	1.8515702929500408e+23
 Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it	1.3173018326546699e+30
 On their being joined by Mr	5782914.523167637
 Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr	1.247491221651899e+26
 Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery	1.3233971159281247e+25
 I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine	5.93854397160916e+33
 How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before	4.8032347031913254e+61
 My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology	28268442947.98936
"  "You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr	575861516504.4415
 Darcy?"  "Indeed I am	74609916.99340016
 I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier	319194537892.24884
 It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night	2.332078027289045e+17
"  Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr	3.0487745032549276e+16
 Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr	2.2166462095073077e+48
--Mr	8733.391073594365
 Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,  "My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained	inf
 You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty	8.970132074637984e+29
 Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself	5.289381814800887e+47
" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr	4582889962211.39
 Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident	1.8222482202276457e+21
 Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh	6.567464973488787e+52
"--It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man	3480204744248477.5
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr	63529939264095.984
 Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility	281750072159756.44
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr	56507691948258.16
 Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way	6.170418593094578e+30
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins then returned to Elizabeth	723220.8876820729
  "I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception	4.829012107337207e+21
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention	54501117.75819936
 He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily	6.613159546296489e+37
 It was really a very handsome thought	60420743.71291445
 Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him	55759993314.16014
"  As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr	1.786088344991733e+25
 Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane	2.107100833831441e+23
 She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters	3.0387301570709694e+38
 Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much	8.506165615939847e+26
 When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr	4.3417998208957504e+63
--It was an animating subject, and Mrs	74842818505.5583
 Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match	2588413182269.0083
 His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	1.5436367001165914e+60
 It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	7.355901907881541e+69
 It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs	1.2000967085406125e+29
 Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life	279856974098977.62
 She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it	6.640461910527998e+25
  In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr	3.827616071924193e+44
 Darcy, who sat opposite to them	65020149.27311887
 Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical	558174329.2106152
  "What is Mr	91928.24337022062
 Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear	6.29329433701665e+38
"  "For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower	46976954398.30782
--What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr	4694803787631.613
 Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing	384198549045.2135
"  Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence	5941566977271.838
 Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone	3356267305509.805
 Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation	3745796470.568609
 She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr	35762405196.215324
 Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her	7.990275386664326e+33
 The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity	1.4001802292951326e+16
  At length however Mrs	67040.55600160058
 Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	1.1962603577401524e+39
 Elizabeth now began to revive	835155.1674728526
 But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company	5.691339676879691e+38
 By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song	3.86814459366233e+41
 Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another	1.727245300207332e+67
 Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected	1.5454524138507545e+21
--Elizabeth was in agonies	8948676.924671289
 She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley	2.4765743205741937e+20
 She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave	1.2325383530662729e+27
 She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night	1.895376534991064e+17
 He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,  "That will do extremely well, child	1.5449521824084545e+25
 You have delighted us long enough	5480092.147576785
 Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit	5859214648.186296
--Others of the party were now applied to	48504722142.29415
  "If I," said Mr	100123650.75460792
 Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman	2.560858811460508e+49
--I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to	7.431183634762368e+33
 The rector of a parish has much to do	5559939169.99915
--In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron	1.894603023907932e+27
 He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible	2.887225291577112e+41
 And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment	6.894768287997393e+29
" And with a bow to Mr	88798438.11221485
 Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room	2.184744594397997e+21
--Many stared	62453.153536141115
--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr	25667272489180.11
 Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr	5284964251.3218775
 Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man	1.4876925486522568e+28
  To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed	inf
 That his two sisters and Mr	7616476.539387009
 Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable	6.775775628765413e+40
  The rest of the evening brought her little amusement	5070909488.068673
 She was teazed by Mr	737458.7049241931
 Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others	1.253872136266202e+34
 In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room	1.2512372633091526e+25
 He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening	4.5103534891212086e+44
 There was no arguing upon such a project	640212963.7115433
 She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr	2.289354221392502e+20
 Collins's conversation to herself	71401.40818287067
  She was at least free from the offence of Mr	47846262091.187546
 Darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak	7.907268470849132e+24
 She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr	65989743910732.49
 Wickham, and rejoiced in it	8627809.179546181
  The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs	4.124936253371568e+19
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves	1.1111232881615919e+24
 They repulsed every attempt of Mrs	7143731.633797236
 Collins, who was complimenting Mr	9465316.826762488
 Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests	1.9896542991805963e+24
 Darcy said nothing at all	706681.772715983
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene	54639974511.80973
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other	2.369119557912311e+20
 Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn	4.0451669075655895e+33
  When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs	43611869238.47286
 Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr	1.8164634215265125e+23
 Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation	1.0353771635747069e+30
 Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time	3.839811310402268e+38
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four months	2.0148623456685027e+46
 Of having another daughter married to Mr	59286952.86360075
 Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr	1.6759076829750568e+36
 Bingley and Netherfield	8749.515888879843
   The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn	3684040597.9624634
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins made his declaration in form	5330153.114150611
 Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business	1.4956652976495916e+61
 On finding Mrs	7272.852045425514
 Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,  "May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"  Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs	9.303761291328696e+72
--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs	493739106030.59534
" And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,  "Dear Ma'am, do not go	2.887499818815097e+24
--I beg you will not go	574770441.7282431
--Mr	8733.391073594365
 Collins must excuse me	65792.51351888943
--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear	2.905978900979237e+16
 I am going away myself	617079.0035174233
"  "No, no, nonsense, Lizzy	9351599462.509218
--I desire you will stay where you are	44572269842.59798
"--And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr	7.219068396351336e+34
 Collins	97.7243836727247
"  Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion	8.688463215985327e+51
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr	421243069345980.6
 Collins began	824.179304616528
  "Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections	1.5561275584352773e+27
 You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address	3.817257816622995e+34
 You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken	6.424258710214143e+28
 Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life	2.0537631887308108e+19
 But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did	2.091287024579739e+43
"  The idea of Mr	956967.0167311401
 Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:  "My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish	9.761577662476802e+75
 Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness	2.5258968009576425e+45
 Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs	4.7894046826963595e+36
 Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr	463932900554620.06
 Collins, you must marry	814398.1172013363
 A clergyman like you must marry	5443392.407547
--Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way	2.02104418894475e+47
 This is my advice	70606.41099009788
 Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her	3.625813814349479e+20
' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer	6.180476992056266e+40
 You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite	3.0850197704516442e+38
 Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women	1.6018328469110911e+38
 But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years	inf
 This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem	1.5372227334714503e+22
 And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection	1.8280983327577387e+21
 To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents	3.51670960282712e+41
 which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to	1.7724951813799887e+20
 On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	4.642482088276438e+29
"  It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	4910893055.218428
  "You are too hasty, Sir," she cried	655696383269.331
 "You forget that I have made no answer	5769672353.43333
 Let me do it without farther loss of time	4113983711.8059034
 Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me	33911463521.918694
 I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them	1.6804352085223714e+23
"  "I am not now to learn," replied Mr	6853381938364.757
 Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time	1.714902340522416e+53
 I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	1.6027410482636274e+25
"  "Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration	2.041234087621254e+23
 I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time	2.308930830859424e+38
 I am perfectly serious in my refusal	49445515.546094984
--You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so	1.510065225051993e+31
--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation	8.629541993604481e+27
 Collins very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you	4465739649301827.0
 And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications	9.833118368493406e+31
"  "Indeed, Mr	1048886.8405376424
 Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary	5358404771.975793
 You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say	2.1332772094423535e+20
 I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise	1.364751883265072e+25
 In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach	7.322320024730998e+34
 This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled	395879320411.25616
" And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr	4.0913640942934707e+18
 Collins thus addressed her,  "When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character	inf
"  "Really, Mr	1030041.6474502381
 Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly	401081472165751.7
 If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one	6.321466857582846e+35
"  "You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course	1.2595554667570975e+26
 My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable	2.8261276691055776e+34
 My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you	8.770157489573669e+58
 Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications	8.883883515112059e+20
 As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females	2.978806634785634e+39
"  "I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man	2.524368264863172e+27
 I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere	338557027759.02997
 I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible	1.5568661600993646e+24
 My feelings in every respect forbid it	48424831.10374297
"  "You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable	2.267409294554633e+43
"  To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	2.7022462351837295e+70
     CHAPTER XX	979.1316786136158
   Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs	2.7871530720389904e+16
 Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection	7.622459795784388e+55
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	5.557270556115787e+58
  This information, however, startled Mrs	63408688.89175677
 Bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so	5.951440951018593e+36
  "But depend upon it, Mr	76193449.53282885
 Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be brought to reason	552502588067057.2
 I will speak to her about it myself directly	5345897297.640191
 She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it	1.6649373721202714e+25
"  "Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr	52602275660357.625
 Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state	3.831041958731923e+39
 If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity	3.319118947248074e+38
"  "Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs	6193595040544.588
 Bennet, alarmed	9066.160985717126
 "Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these	38304469565.983665
 In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived	248603108686495.66
 I will go directly to Mr	7032867.666959025
 Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure	4918887306947616.0
"  She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,  "Oh! Mr	1.6719277516826844e+29
 Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar	48337046076449.61
 You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr	520310994.830467
 Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_	2.5059301908706058e+29
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication	6.234488000213109e+30
  "I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech	4.5874450480882667e+20
 "Of what are you talking?"  "Of Mr	741961954039.9879
 Collins and Lizzy	8628.822784444827
 Collins, and Mr	106175.0393979565
 Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy	47332838571.473564
 Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him	4702225478.021597
"  "Let her be called down	67392356.53808329
 She shall hear my opinion	634750.3983081282
 Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library	57301085278011.71
  "Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared	50987092993185.34
 "I have sent for you on an affair of importance	472368597064.2853
 I understand that Mr	84297.37156672089
 Collins has made you an offer of marriage	494999721.48037845
 Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was	62219667062.89203
 "Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"  "I have, Sir	3.44543692121925e+17
"  "Very well	95384.28328193592
 We now come to the point	6910569.742215671
 Your mother insists upon your accepting it	52818301.46115992
 Is not it so, Mrs	9288285.098412286
 Bennet?"  "Yes, or I will never see her again	51037777649587.125
"  "An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth	57647626362.83721
 From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents	38711598542719.52
--Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr	2.438605564267948e+17
 Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_	498252899368190.2
"  Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs	3.197159499613687e+17
 Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed	2.1461683163828396e+19
  "What do you mean, Mr	80770709.1487151
 Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him	2.241985304398206e+19
"  "My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request	3.8515890539736264e+18
 First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room	1.8405210881943803e+24
 I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be	4201251474480284.5
"  Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs	5.29949799921303e+17
 Bennet give up the point	673734.3205092433
 She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns	538442314826025.2
 She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	4.160570160541364e+30
 Though her manner varied however, her determination never did	40797181832.628624
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed	3792846502155.519
 He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way	7.413911752033101e+29
 His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret	1.2231746811381542e+22
  While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them	2.607694746843362e+17
 She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr	8.5507287029381e+41
 Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him	452569862369853.4
"  Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs	8.664199791214561e+33
 Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family	9.070433292045399e+36
 "Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves	2.640204130787486e+41
 Bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way	1.3331217544598672e+30
--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead	1.4400118208749494e+54
--_I_ shall not be able to keep you--and so I warn you	2.717107604608443e+16
--I have done with you from this very day	489259749605.6814
--I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word	2.170645985267555e+31
 I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children	6102097407.333571
--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body	373166584156495.9
 People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking	1.3820569256759696e+16
 Nobody can tell what I suffer!--But it is always so	47018714444.44154
"  Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation	1.3179509101452298e+25
 She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr	2.598677341774268e+18
 Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,  "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr	1.1693868422304217e+46
 Collins and me have a little conversation together	552993881.9728972
"  Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr	1.1195304166079824e+37
 Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear	9.136572817472889e+32
 In a doleful voice Mrs	825959.5815406065
 Bennet thus began the projected conversation	6374141.305858115
--"Oh! Mr	7011775.76461381
 Collins!"--  "My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point	1.9094135752685913e+24
 Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter	1.6478744959688783e+26
 Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned	3.079945315120563e+36
 Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation	4.018138436613674e+47
 You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr	5.436441505679048e+36
 Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf	37875608011579.14
 My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own	1.0563348680058698e+20
 But we are all liable to error	50741367.440066315
 I have certainly meant well through the whole affair	3927884393.6055965
 My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise	2.6550666820176146e+40
"     CHAPTER XXI	10016.96156119488
   The discussion of Mr	87219.01039310404
 Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother	4.678616800373934e+31
 As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence	5.742725640966028e+34
 He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend	9.573728228269454e+51
  The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs	63092904.970585085
 Bennet's ill humour or ill health	3892459.345365217
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins was also in the same state of angry pride	40827319359.23505
 Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it	1.8714443126736975e+23
 He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay	3.271081292596159e+17
  After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr	3918064146009.7656
 He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over	7.69321044909082e+30
--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed	1.9529645676718904e+22
  "I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr	4.425822955802505e+22
 Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself	6.862132353783828e+36
"  She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her	2.018845513261321e+52
 His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	7.921253151997822e+33
  Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately	2.0989112539037657e+22
 The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	1.2030683364075576e+44
 Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs	3.072037267902929e+61
 When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,  "This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal	1.0105930182688433e+33
 The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again	1.2223152233047086e+26
 You shall hear what she says	5880274.692615096
"  She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr	4.059927302399692e+39
 Hurst had a house	76215.58042182615
 The next was in these words	6863467.539105709
 "I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence	2.833565597795341e+61
 I depend on you for that	7673775.471763944
" To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr	3.398799677083737e+48
  "It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country	1.859324216410814e+30
 But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--Mr	1.8634551928463544e+45
"  "Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter	1.7234911919972776e+16
 I will read it to you--  "When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel	inf
 Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I despair	1.3124360880156997e+38
 I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you	4.730863405394378e+42
"  "It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter	2.893656608212304e+21
"  "Why will you think so? It must be his own doing	417250270757012.0
--He is his own master	58787136.30435724
 I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me	4274725696119.685
 I will have no reserves from _you_	5435946512.0979185
" "Mr	10876.835996291326
 Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again	1.6648006157865994e+25
 I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister	1.6297067430086467e+48
 I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable	5.1334242007924374e+36
 My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart	7.094769970409038e+55
 With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"  "What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"--said Jane as she finished it	2.6004754435158577e+56
 "Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"  "Yes, there can; for mine is totally different	1.9715308051659237e+79
--Will you hear it?"  "Most willingly	457159575469.4537
"  "You shall have it in few words	6485095990.521661
 Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy	2.7968999957683606e+19
 She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you	2.45070246035838e+25
"  Jane shook her head	664006.1072419588
  "Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me	74405159563.51859
--No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection	2656568507415637.5
 Miss Bingley I am sure cannot	5841872.735365888
 She is not such a simpleton	7239650.275912674
 Could she have seen half as much love in Mr	49267161585.84955
 Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes	420772989927.38586
 But the case is this	775541.8760685695
 We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way	4.1803022288188184e+72
 But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend	3.6026094948029864e+73
"  "If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy	1.888873556628358e+26
 But I know the foundation is unjust	56624568.44931248
 Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself	1.6488745898975623e+25
--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine	1.8349401023111224e+20
 Believe her to be deceived by all means	560558339.856591
 You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer	340885357497048.5
"  "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"  "You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him	inf
"  "How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate	1.462779041564626e+27
"  "I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion	2.8048668923730235e+21
"  "But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required	2.4032687726615955e+17
 A thousand things may arise in six months!"  The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt	8.645860050848043e+22
 It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one	3.4373337328859653e+40
  She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	1.4246071953042606e+26
 Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	7.616625549900547e+36
  They agreed that Mrs	72554.63419084047
 Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together	5.778806427177489e+58
 After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr	4.011940120508111e+16
     CHAPTER XXII	979.1316786136158
   The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr	1.5741944693537708e+29
 Collins	97.7243836727247
 Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her	53056450.63177763
" Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time	1.6792548168192905e+25
 Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself	399035751.19837147
 But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet	4.514117415478799e+42
 He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday	2.3383255098872774e+72
 Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane	6.64505701785373e+25
 But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	4.5274284953148856e+16
  In as short a time as Mr	72161771.0635063
 Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness	9.122645672199921e+63
 The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained	7.459832107355274e+51
  Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity	1.0160396268515766e+22
 Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair	4.050921055351927e+29
 Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr	1.0717776299984157e+22
 Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr	2.3126553271567987e+19
 Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St	9.437026755610332e+26
 James's	88.88738839060083
 The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion	421007595583.1182
 The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid	1.2446328533472282e+35
 Charlotte herself was tolerably composed	509133.3966530092
 She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it	60418835683028.1
 Her reflections were in general satisfactory	5355405.222403247
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary	1.672373431861867e+23
 But still he would be her husband	63516357.59277514
--Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want	1.017107033307426e+46
 This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it	1.5526921159615203e+28
 She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr	60431245731560.35
 Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family	2.2141734693945827e+22
 A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	2.9851420038654395e+65
 Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them	6.173598470442167e+28
  "My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible	6.358742442512628e+43
"  They were all astonished; and Mr	689256324.1139119
 Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,  "But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness	1.715291793490414e+45
"  "My dear sir," replied Mr	7524840965.064485
 Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence	6.197490929104688e+29
"  "You cannot be too much on your guard	50380278523.52982
 Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence	1.4024675140015992e+46
"  "Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire	1.1009410127282674e+51
 As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth	3.659106614121031e+36
"  With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return	1.062591558651917e+22
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	1.0059073221270516e+30
 She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion	6.3385003972707015e+56
 But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away	354199930341927.2
 Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before	1.7249821576414162e+21
  The possibility of Mr	89435.01620583833
 Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,  "Engaged to Mr	3.74335035548408e+68
 Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"  The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,  "Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible that Mr	5.211930225840706e+69
 Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"  But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness	9.229783832366237e+65
  "I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr	3.4320894911426745e+21
 Collins was wishing to marry you	6749718.640358705
 But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done	2.8135311048270547e+23
 I am not romantic you know	8520734.915297275
 I never was	9780.027555684936
 I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr	40786213008.767166
 Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state	5.956297531826071e+33
 Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard	2.449748126628745e+19
 It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match	2.9208995609108095e+19
 The strangeness of Mr	114355.65010497245
 Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted	1.2958943224261374e+19
 Charlotte the wife of Mr	791012.7252973387
 Collins, was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen	5.0934390993456695e+42
     CHAPTER XXIII	979.1316786136158
   Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family	4.2379817804120877e+43
 With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs	6.38424565316626e+33
 Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,  "Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know that Mr	3.728401987384174e+45
 Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"  Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy	3.6461466673709973e+59
  Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr	inf
 Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London	48315942353.401535
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent	3.362629554505035e+30
 In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr	3.415675062489243e+23
 Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off	1.6808211747104977e+28
 Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	3.4913811950395286e+53
 Nothing could console and nothing appease her	66051312.4107823
--Nor did that day wear out her resentment	44610407807.048294
 A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter	1.108508464393427e+42
 Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!  Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	inf
 Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr	4615573223950.214
 Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton	1.3113553583487902e+24
  Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs	2671810297702118.0
 Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs	1.0027234667110195e+28
  Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again	6.042767837840332e+30
 Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return	1.8900354014427723e+54
  Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again	1.416247003223324e+24
 The promised letter of thanks from Mr	57627912.388869494
 After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men	inf
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs	28728146940003.266
--It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome	1.2296274625086155e+26
--She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable	1.1438496963971015e+25
 Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs	71742919.79285051
 Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr	50847907454794.58
 Bingley's continued absence	6469.071400574251
  Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject	3604318585.350856
 Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs	1.6207601222541777e+36
 Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood	326336903382892.3
 Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring	1.1970005175704267e+31
 The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment	7.635919214894047e+40
  As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to	1.0016853893186126e+45
 But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used	1.6683940527656958e+49
 It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity	13642869903157.344
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction	7.359128080270243e+26
 He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company	1.4519685216959299e+31
 The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed	5.366724302509247e+34
 Bennet was really in a most pitiable state	479999588.14815336
 The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	1.0063812592226278e+30
 The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her	5871748985.976232
 Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr	9.881589802312268e+26
 Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr	2.0061334583195804e+30
 Bennet were dead	7297.835613079886
 She complained bitterly of all this to her husband	6683076916.324472
  "Indeed, Mr	102534.1224762123
 Let us hope for better things	4733595.71602189
 Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor	3963615139752.1724
"  This was not very consoling to Mrs	678314876.9285992
 Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before,  "I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate	2.0451666870874132e+31
 If it was not for the entail I should not mind it	5140241537056.411
"  "Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility	2.5237231796024652e+16
"  "I never can be thankful, Mr	7403567627.938816
 Bennet, for any thing about the entail	605492608.1134905
 How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr	8.256380583187073e+26
 Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"  "I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr	2.099979816553033e+26

     PRIDE & PREJUDICE	6033.456572070744
     CHAPTER I	953.5291521241652
 The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country	2.3774271231326723e+42
 Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it	459515640.1126548
 Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter	6.105449991789327e+33
 She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr	348184373313027.8
 Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture	2.1525632468822495e+18
  Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation	2.701429001860152e+19
 Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others	2.575477680835678e+16
 To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit	2146636291441001.2
 Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself	4.29977166274206e+44
 It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing	3.152109482720741e+20
 She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded	1.0995121455255038e+70
  A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs	1.8910214884820517e+22
 But I will not repine	713864.5805653181
 It cannot last long	69871.86362512338
 He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before	432503550723806.94
"  Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing	37152212212830.484
  "You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason	3.1364779367130424e+18
 He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all	2.5393267463596327e+19
 I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with	3935423404213032.0
 Thank God! I have not _that_ pain	41514143176.52114
 A little time therefore	74996.12872615865
--I shall certainly try to get the better	42844320066.96556
"  With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself	4.5294083486469314e+42
"  "My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good	4727674581261332.0
 Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you	4.27441444884391e+17
 I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve	2.8422551587715325e+17
"  Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection	1.5134976246537394e+19
  "Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair	6951461861054.364
 _You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body	2.1338121823689743e+21
 You need not	8623.526996801558
 There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well	2.869699238164471e+17
 The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense	3.551558538229107e+46
 I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage	1.6596086684755421e+19
 It is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!"  "My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these	1.2301211292967098e+26
 They will ruin your happiness	580071.6752317335
 You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper	4101054630471.0166
 Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character	3938123694.3418612
 Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin	3.0139484454722197e+44
"  "To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart	2.1558929137093865e+56
 Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking	1.005289164546976e+48
 You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas	481595835370.5135
 You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness	5.675337923762241e+39
"  "I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together	1.3731524438200809e+34
 But enough of this	84822.74898804708
 You alluded to something else	649769.3151933643
 You mentioned _two_ instances	5322904.403559363
 I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk	1.028283251540727e+34
 We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured	262431422476.33878
 We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect	2977430517617514.0
 It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us	3608891191666.01
 Women fancy admiration means more than it does	344040515.55321515
"  "And men take care that they should	5868840930.521564
"  "If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine	1.1310108384695904e+31
"  "I am far from attributing any part of Mr	621410764409.0386
 Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery	1.2837795670880153e+33
"  "And do you impute it to either of those?"  "Yes; to the last	6.1501705142792266e+19
 But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem	3.1205072992559346e+19
 Stop me whilst you can	552518.3596541538
"  "You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him	50863673082550.17
"  "I cannot believe it	8304093.731265506
 They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride	2.63988421116202e+39
"  "Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing	1.0449429568566194e+33
 They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better	1.8542327875499213e+19
 What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed	2.9842477803927487e+42
 By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy	2.123345566482114e+19
 Do not distress me by the idea	58123087.18490347
 I am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters	1.2204092557559036e+34
 Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood	2.9123144041903713e+18
"  Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr	416572229905422.6
 Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them	355665086.70402074
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity	2.4517368374501757e+40
 Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day	2.111799412061129e+61
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet's best comfort was, that Mr	64706721.26678659
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bennet treated the matter differently	527737.5681276098
 "So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find	3.801345234928057e+20
 I congratulate her	8734.897010299168
 Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then	2.603970890302222e+18
 It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions	3.4347759602458336e+17
 When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane	2.776198928710613e+17
 Now is your time	75073.11458475895
 Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country	2291743994414410.0
 Let Wickham be _your_ man	55116689.98680883
 He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably	707350816087.5242
"  "Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me	3912607186942210.5
 We must not all expect Jane's good fortune	410320036.93816924
"  "True," said Mr	92422581.6278522
 Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it	2.1257336682355632e+33
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family	1.348723020463874e+24
 They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve	5.1700720721400896e+17
 Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr	6.93081323237863e+32
 Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter	49101584134.43742
 Darcy was condemned as the worst of men	521628508.27244747
     CHAPTER II	753.0020911079799
   After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr	321181092059451.5
 Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday	3435903053278.9023
 He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks	4.191343222308579e+31
  On the following Monday, Mrs	6907620.891277962
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education	2.25668136487286e+20
 The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable	5.702668621751409e+32
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs	4441761324.422404
 Bennet and Mrs	9465.946701842275
 Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces	2.5492460019133327e+20
 Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard	260594053780223.25
 They had frequently been staying with her in town	4780113066.106097
  The first part of Mrs	797160.2278180411
 Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions	3.5209242025062188e+16
 When this was done, she had a less active part to play	40121183158525.46
 It became her turn to listen	5978328.441181221
 Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of	4768158494495.925
 They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister	4354259535867.1978
 Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it	3.8070318814312255e+20
  "I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr	4.453735838878907e+18
 Bingley, if she could	921602.7649418986
 But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr	2.9807392916442874e+20
 Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness	348363935116123.2
 The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever	1.4204708798326376e+29
 The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister	5458856211.603554
 They are all for what they can get	532462270.8223213
 I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is	62408016928026.125
 It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else	1.2943449937108913e+28
 However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves	1.6866044101733085e+29
 Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation	7.780982160503525e+40
  When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject	4236160275810.884
 "It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she	3.9117873041234504e+16
 "I am sorry it went off	59276041.217928454
 But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr	2.408288007156998e+16
 Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent	8.966502266587348e+34
"  "An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not do for _us_	3.022617012747166e+23
 We do not suffer by _accident_	442975125.63644624
 It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before	3.493101773040012e+37
"  "But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea	1.8030145678390007e+28
 It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment	2.2360095766611939e+21
 Pray, how _violent was_ Mr	596899783.3606733
 Bingley's love?"  "I never saw a more promising inclination	3328875222963.4663
 He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her	282702454536448.25
 Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable	433012824177.95435
 At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer	6.637266343853994e+30
 Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"  "Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt	1.1156481937457494e+32
 Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately	2.453615025618408e+22
 It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner	2.406670370427154e+21
"  Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence	3.072921962871918e+17
  "I hope," added Mrs	85346881.99152918
 Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her	3457840606231787.5
 We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her	3.500635725996416e+47
"  "And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr	5.1110523852948e+23
 Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr	6.621345693447744e+43
 Bingley never stirs without him	741780.073283971
"  "So much the better	8658474.544635622
 I hope they will not meet at all	567143162.9741364
 But does not Jane correspond with the sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling	2.8038257785036325e+19
"  "She will drop the acquaintance entirely	576955046.6723034
"  But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless	1.4902069148420335e+53
 It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions	1.4854349772012631e+34
  Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him	1.392370868036036e+54
  The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement	1.5800405666729125e+29
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner	1.3531737182432052e+25
 When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr	3.2068457133430397e+21
 Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs	47345566837430.7
 Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both	2194293103564656.5
 Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment	1.6909085631175184e+56
  To Mrs	1036.8689870095016
 Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers	2538436263574604.5
 About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he belonged	1.014037624254155e+29
 They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring	3.621482723199216e+53
 Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr	51866471038.26358
 Darcy by character perfectly well	605893.5670048731
 Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse	482885101.40901506
 In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself	1.0767853657653567e+38
 On being made acquainted with the present Mr	513156048.1510516
 Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr	5.81675631043689e+37
 Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy	2729362225395.695
     CHAPTER III	746.2740688337336
   Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:  "You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly	4.351816786432613e+64
 Seriously, I would have you be on your guard	55717544573.840004
 Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent	1.136727939233018e+23
 I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better	9.750743254334905e+36
 But as it is--you must not let your fancy run away with you	37171505532850.664
 You have sense, and we all expect you to use it	5774526680536.11
 Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure	2.555747807573563e+16
 You must not disappoint your father	5862718.657351547
"  "My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed	485364033065.30084
"  "Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise	521956384380903.06
"  "Well, then, you need not be under any alarm	52219334858152.42
 I will take care of myself, and of Mr	72012192654.60246
 Wickham too	856.5619193270165
 He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it	466975299431106.8
"  "Elizabeth, you are not serious now	7737496962.385542
"  "I beg your pardon	6968638.242451561
 At present I am not in love with Mr	5961340550.026336
 Wickham; no, I certainly am not	704350433.7727299
 But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be better that he should not	1.0858833916697817e+31
 I see the imprudence of it	7901232.6178195365
--Oh! _that_ abominable Mr	4640838871.12273
 Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it	2.8951153396659802e+19
 My father, however, is partial to Mr	7059653278.767459
 Wickham	96.30085307271028
 In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry	inf
 I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object	41849136333415.94
 When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing	50404534577916.05
 In short, I will do my best	658810281.939087
"  "Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often	2.994545012051177e+18
"  "As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_	1.8369712307941434e+34
 But do not imagine that he is always here so often	396894049895.1796
 It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week	254107184272253.16
 You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends	2592726594050155.0
 But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied	2.1204781016759558e+28
"  Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented	4.678796157473192e+38
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs	4.642415917024333e+34
 Bennet	101.78305820814953
 His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she "_wished_ they might be happy	3.889271345263242e+39
" Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room	1.9291061117305438e+49
"  "_That_ you certainly shall	740478213.8562373
"  "And I have another favour to ask	6731871740.426576
 Will you come and see me?"  "We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire	3.3926440929311842e+19
"  "I am not likely to leave Kent for some time	4497657190336.8
 Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford	6782293174.934869
"  Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit	507056230487077.2
  "My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party	2.6252723053457538e+29
 Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them	4710935835407860.0
"  The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual	6.452603289027012e+34
 Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible	8.101342115340708e+28
 Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was	1.1305600820100133e+41
 Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	2.3912156122890926e+68
 She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise	3.830652803575664e+17
 The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging	2.869594855904248e+25
 It was Mr	10073.092934631459
 Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest	1.0148871539470781e+26
  Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys	4.240116992232179e+37
  Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is	218899095096442.1
 Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline	2275911032812554.5
 She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been lost	2.296717794988707e+25
"  She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley	3.8852103941657384e+16
 "I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London	1.1675426184405386e+37
 I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her	40860065927891.92
 I enquired after their brother, of course	575204053.2213198
 He was well, but so much engaged with Mr	63274088537.25219
 Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him	616498207.9152123
 I wish I could see her	7538732.652995206
 My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs	57686994853.0243
 Hurst were going out	62084.2336162498
 I dare say I shall soon see them here	4224293386.4225035
 It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr	490980308535.6084
 Bingley her sister's being in town	6044976.754747354
  Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him	418036690751.7772
 She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention	1.3389537863400606e+23
 After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer	2.830258470400155e+51
 The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt	3.003401273372027e+17
       "My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in      her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have      been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me	6.032572562027263e+37
 But, my      dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me      obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour      was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion	5.212908511595566e+39
 I do not at      all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but      if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should      be deceived again	7.620646018744536e+33
 Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;      and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time	1.4584038158135563e+25
 When      she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;      she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said      not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so      altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly      resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer	1.3228455347135332e+67
 I pity, though I      cannot help blaming her	6396301982.934536
 She was very wrong in singling me out as      she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on      her side	1.3485639219904454e+26
 But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been      acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her      brother is the cause of it	1.032585362395019e+32
 I need not explain myself farther; and      though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she      feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so      deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may      feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable	1.0037116661015516e+59
 I cannot but wonder,      however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at      all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago	8.923473646827824e+33
 I cannot      understand it	76385.47458484661
 If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should      be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of      duplicity in all this	1.5395711154728401e+28
 But I will endeavour to banish every painful      thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,      and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt	1.1844718284397268e+33
 Let me hear      from you very soon	54026265.96778829
 We had better not mention it	6319548.803664982
 I am extremely      glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at      Hunsford	1770218613837440.5
 Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria	425287518221.7748
 I am      sure you will be very comfortable there	4957624224.8113365
       "Your's, &c	661329.4685891892
"  This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least	1.2349605415245716e+28
 All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over	3989587610.998108
 She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions	410453601337.4017
 Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away	1.90119524037503e+20
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	5.877483889251293e+33
 His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else	3.769382650353101e+19
 Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain	3.045091673047836e+21
 Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it	9.168269328603497e+29
 The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	2.8655920234459366e+48
 Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy	3.1639228197936106e+47
  All this was acknowledged to Mrs	7247021.857903818
 Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil	1.6039529838860333e+55
 But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King	1.1509296576761571e+19
 I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl	1.5323023613504953e+28
 My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance	5.907891769303611e+37
 Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly	34610607.47928272
 Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do	41052919922572.195
 They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain	8.190277640599776e+33
"     CHAPTER IV	7624.360156071657
   With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away	6.767097600627951e+33
 March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford	61950661.58280627
 She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty	3.11285971744669e+40
 Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr	3.2666204987035716e+16
 Collins	97.7243836727247
 There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	1.5481335302850278e+35
 The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay	1.5069437902661562e+31
 Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch	2.6135705500626893e+18
 She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter	44594041803.15008
 The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be	1.6853168245243352e+22
  The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter	9.845255859186725e+46
  The farewell between herself and Mr	6440908.421742857
 Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more	35746772379.79135
 His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing	inf
  Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable	4.1033520148679905e+18
 Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise	5.3335896334530935e+44
 Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long	2862366227784.6733
 He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information	1.419795938347441e+24
  It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon	2.460240861440371e+22
 As they drove to Mr	789067.3789460383
 Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever	3.695938322296034e+43
 On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower	2.395467695634791e+45
 All was joy and kindness	690271.2154464341
 The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres	4.3176371743893674e+22
  Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt	492328721.9222323
 Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection	7.663745067044154e+38
 It was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long	5306379217283625.0
 Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance	5.263508730118253e+39
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well	2.2899438922884186e+17
  "But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary	1.5024062882553693e+29
"  "Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary	2.4484930725119946e+73
"  "If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think	2.141610376763906e+22
"  "She is a very good kind of girl, I believe	60415093742907.27
 I know no harm of her	7190504.934884586
"  "No--why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"  "But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event	6.5897232489515855e+66
"  "A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe	1.5323847498724422e+20
 If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?"  "_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_	1.5780489570479835e+30
 It only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling	338145485640.8602
"  "Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose	761659384772467.8
 _He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish	408981605533567.94
"  "No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose	5802906190399969.0
 I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire	2.2837094865746895e+22
"  "Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better	5.571072961554505e+34
 I am sick of them all	6778699.910793502
 Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all	286666026376.1643
"  "Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment	40189678105870.18
"  Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer	4.901108531497899e+37
  "We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs	2.744759431508727e+16
 Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes	748187597.4698155
"  No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful	2.4138832982589435e+22
 "My dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour	2.2606465623974918e+26
 Adieu to disappointment and spleen	777488.8329483668
 What are men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing	2.744603580664498e+44
 We _will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen	2.267483404662048e+17
 Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation	5.25809304059374e+34
 Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers	2.133466181308242e+16
"     CHAPTER V	7605.231023931897
   Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight	1.0099233182057206e+54
  When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view	8.763305246706959e+29
 The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side	310035078065.4754
 Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants	357225496955771.9
  At length the Parsonage was discernible	7268150.614163544
 The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving	3.1905482288800066e+27
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party	6.496887596575818e+36
 In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other	3.037171274062377e+18
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received	1.2581315298169656e+26
 They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment	1.210900201604389e+55
  Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him	2.2663576406382102e+52
 But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion	4.318174419141078e+42
 When Mr	943.2496258441263
 Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte	1.1699961728015684e+26
 Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear	1.530486666484163e+18
 After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London, Mr	1.2456238702280335e+38
 Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself	2.4008263337029526e+28
 To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible	5.992682203805128e+39
 Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind	1.7609393721946736e+38
 He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump	1.9534969349589617e+22
 But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house	1.9477253464127222e+48
 It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground	2414719941916.14
  From his garden, Mr	829259.7892978946
 Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help	8.283583456677104e+60
 When Mr	943.2496258441263
 Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten	8.194384438883219e+29
  She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country	3721430984817.2446
 It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr	43017379480520.55
 Collins joining in, observed,  "Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her	7.6680489133552525e+40
 She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over	1.2336048683578845e+26
 I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here	7.41454094122333e+27
 Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming	517446122.51641273
 We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home	2130547475131833.0
 Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us	464573493.4540568
 I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several	3.828943415304888e+16
"  "Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour	2.195096851845371e+23
"  "Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say	534904123809071.44
"  The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well	8.398326874632254e+65
 She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr	2.59217799315535e+24
 Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings	54844525716.16598
 A lively imagination soon settled it all	47431960.20060761
  About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her	7.130324249752515e+53
 She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,  "Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is	3.2624720409295523e+55
 Make haste, and come down this moment	513794643.6318977
"  Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate	1.4719306008732274e+45
  "And is this all?" cried Elizabeth	7266453740.320602
 "I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!"  "La! my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine	3.9464783900507435e+46
 The old lady is Mrs	686894.19874717
 Jenkinson, who lives with them	6043787.2903977595
 The other is Miss De Bourgh	5976794.686215307
 Only look at her	77484.26679993178
 She is quite a little creature	6258329.786768939
 Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"  "She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind	1.0202758103615902e+28
 Why does she not come in?"  "Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does	2.3332621734865567e+18
 It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in	3151582297864.013
"  "I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas	4888706645064282.0
 "She looks sickly and cross	5774298.368543372
--Yes, she will do for him very well	523589485633.2045
 She will make him a very proper wife	503631721.83728695
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way	1.9305185295056053e+48
  At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house	2.3546923056885918e+22
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day	2.0639083077592657e+37
     CHAPTER VI	742.6610242200244
   Mr	103.65865118859166
 The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	5.695447012821805e+62
  "I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings	7.494400926981333e+33
 I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen	3849352456631886.5
 But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"  "I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire	7.3669890027545e+77
 About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	2822364423024.9053
"  Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings	2.3242726483251036e+19
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them	1.0843142683309147e+33
  When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,  "Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel	2.4238253557515803e+28
 Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter	1.685865044873747e+18
 I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more	1.1547739962476463e+26
 Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed	37249247671863.47
 She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved	4535603994.35044
"  While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner	4.0011071768607864e+35
--Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St	1.9057656897707113e+52
 James's	88.88738839060083
  As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park	1.919447939712072e+19
--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr	1.0235985196830117e+30
 Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh	5.649043949570042e+38
  When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm	7.308336558164349e+24
--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her	419999850.7231574
 She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation	8.003756969150714e+34
  From the entrance hall, of which Mr	664155617.2608589
 Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs	7.901893114324898e+35
 Jenkinson were sitting	6638.984207623069
--Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs	3.396472330377413e+17
 Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary	6.201902320466427e+36
  In spite of having been at St	54920399.781064846
 James's, Sir William was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look	7.161022975783678e+61
 Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly	2.1347892441923525e+18
--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome	2.103890422026746e+21
 Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank	1.8267167541329873e+24
 She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr	1.1044195102109404e+29
 Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented	1.2543982103316756e+26
  When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr	2.985668818886721e+19
 Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small	1.5868989527197168e+28
 There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies	27488880110586.62
 Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs	1.1340289334642437e+32
 Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes	9.778487088250274e+32
  After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, Mr	2.6746764460933314e+22
  The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr	3.8845054467724096e+21
 Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater	8.088219202961939e+39
 But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them	4.4675007685098135e+27
 The party did not supply much conversation	51584152.98702549
 Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time	3.7185620696788507e+43
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed	4.813039270119214e+25
 Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire	2.380612216715765e+17
  When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted	1.7826283034231185e+54
 Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others	1.643128744537116e+22
 In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs	629468736.4442443
 Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs	1.6555075597769532e+33
 Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl	514552024306.68726
 She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly	4.820557543705862e+68
--Lady Catherine then observed,  "Your father's estate is entailed on Mr	2259789873294249.0
--It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family	24321085409264.99
--Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?"  "A little	4216091571112371.0
"  "Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you	3861974869543360.5
 Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it some day	2021662317002957.5
--Do your sisters play and sing?"  "One of them does	2985401128480548.0
"  "Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned	48884744698090.09
 The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's	2.8297618384054963e+17
--Do you draw?"  "No, not at all	54479185946968.42
"  "What, none of you?"  "Not one	8194162167932.055
"  "That is very strange	7823219.697592335
 Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters	2276452064524684.0
"  "My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London	3299391277873682.0
"  "Has your governess left you?"  "We never had any governess	3361908503543354.0
"  "No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing	1.1972114415778794e+25
 Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education	460656575445.5831
"  Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case	3.489970876775082e+17
  "Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess you must have been neglected	2.1469660567583746e+20
"  "Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means	1.798561399516335e+25
 We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary	3433666382705564.0
 Those who chose to be idle, certainly might	4542409245.8111925
"  "Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one	8.72275061354017e+33
 I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it	1.0457503470056465e+25
 It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way	3.242722131495592e+16
 I am always glad to get a young person well placed out	2766184062772.5845
 Four nieces of Mrs	67898.41169120016
 Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her	3.519800141549848e+39
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure	3.4521996615817584e+21
' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"  "Yes, Ma'am, all	2.9060895025879302e+19
"  "All!--What, all five out at once? Very odd!--And you only the second	4.620702386377082e+16
--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your younger sisters must be very young?"  "Yes, my youngest is not sixteen	8.696676515266592e+26
 Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company	4022989255554.686
 But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early	3.255104354700137e+39
--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first	2.7759378590884897e+19
 And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind	1.1053317426726383e+26
"  "Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person	2.262922173251678e+23
--Pray, what is your age?"  "With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it	6.657714217589142e+32
"  Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	3.054422605914947e+32
  "You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age	2.831722144999424e+17
"  "I am not one and twenty	752149779.4543461
"  When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed	2.5993597522527053e+18
 Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr	725059676.2614838
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs	1.1536619293180404e+26
 Jenkinson to make up her party	5938638.191217699
 Their table was superlatively stupid	662536.609153578
 Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs	2.515105758254374e+16
 Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light	5.512857860587568e+22
 A great deal more passed at the other table	4228342979.91785
 Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself	2.796228140541661e+18
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many	6.274707200360774e+28
 Sir William did not say much	5491694.5212912345
 He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names	53178605061.15141
  When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs	1.639701017061827e+26
 Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered	534633590.85493755
 The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow	1.4305041317730792e+21
 From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr	2.0512429888549712e+21
 As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was	6.191699848649862e+44
 But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr	3.4009544429672604e+16
 Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands	2.5241679519307875e+17
     CHAPTER VII	747.3324493257456
   Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with	2.5027690812410994e+42
 While Sir William was with them, Mr	618591271.4723531
 Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road	inf
 The room in which the ladies sat was backwards	6976585879.818713
 Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr	2.0822650388248366e+47
 Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement	7.284359367375792e+27
  From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr	3.3478291200106332e+16
 Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day	2.537117541868841e+38
 She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out	1.3073793694171634e+27
  Very few days passed in which Mr	52447165.88177995
 Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours	3.264954219400004e+48
 Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits	1.01653422800319e+28
 She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs	9.152335713078781e+53
  Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr	7.594236398066753e+41
  The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first	4.087725453515402e+42
 This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors	2.1302527566775387e+49
 Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity	5.45947013074587e+57
 Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr	57190587436.618256
 Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself	inf
  His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr	521689860819.4501
 Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence	1.3803734983557483e+44
 On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects	3123089482914.3647
 There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr	35307507836396.97
 Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr	1.4259697378498597e+33
 Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him	5206205.311784887
 Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,  "I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility	3.16561833154856e+44
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me	378667255931.46
"  Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room	9.544952104339642e+30
 Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman	1.7019291866988254e+24
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs	1.8690085285981575e+24
 Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure	2.3334588739916235e+19
 Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word	57950043822.07184
  Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs	3.4701845201610186e+37
 Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body	404662106550.60345
 At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family	2.4851584784937897e+22
 She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added,  "My eldest sister has been in town these three months	1.1564216067765257e+27
 Have you never happened to see her there?"  She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet	6.3320308125463e+61
 The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away	311180908623214.4
     CHAPTER VIII	753.1610575185248
   Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings	6.96456095012732e+28
 It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening	7.456426464463785e+66
 Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr	2.501210239263522e+16
 Darcy they had only seen at church	51899145.29317143
 Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room	1.465947419669269e+57
  Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs	1.3169033823026407e+22
 Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much	26154634141.762432
 He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr	9.063378022372347e+66
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
 _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out,  "What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is	3.374933132435448e+72
"  "We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply	2.7094514526302287e+22
  "Of music! Then pray speak aloud	425278672.9474169
 I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music	3869880549766449.5
 There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste	9.471561477064276e+24
 If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient	52462703924204.52
 And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply	41830001599638.37
 I am confident that she would have performed delightfully	3989082569.569891
 How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"  Mr	47532649533.298164
 Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency	4749841085.139421
"  "I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice	4.6042193952629404e+20
 She practises very constantly	59828.15490239644
"  "So much the better	8658474.544635622
 It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account	1.7565253297736185e+26
 I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice	1.711519031327266e+19
 I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs	1.3400085358549594e+24
 Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in Mrs	1.5636846202984927e+31
 Jenkinson's room	977.5849484754933
 She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house	7.1865598347638424e+16
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer	2569907367006027.5
  When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument	1.2261942075237362e+25
 He drew a chair near her	5611215.026007236
 Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance	1.551259958238064e+51
 Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,  "You mean to frighten me, Mr	2.72341705077569e+33
 Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well	1.095984174592123e+27
 There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others	3.010111685976087e+18
"  "I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own	1.512138099412651e+60
"  Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say	6.985749038804152e+38
 I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit	3.97613653565755e+37
 Indeed, Mr	9999.751291125163
 Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear	5.7883352711713e+49
"  "I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly	719256480789593.5
  "Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam	2.931094457662384e+17
 "I should like to know how he behaves among strangers	332956206795.14874
"  "You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful	3410890610175.764
 The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances! I am sorry to pain you--but so it was	3.9920929966193434e+44
 He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner	8.484711794765512e+30
 Mr	103.65865118859166
"  "I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party	2.3793708338970766e+21
"  "True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room	326611544354842.8
 Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders	1.9234901420588252e+16
"  "Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	1.3010163263716407e+31
"  "Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam	2.0184164697163134e+20
 "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"  "I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to him	3.2134300821100273e+46
 It is because he will not give himself the trouble	46758595464.02195
 I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done	1.5063826402609277e+20
"  "My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do	2.1696483005366532e+27
 It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution	1.444826321008561e+21
"  Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right	568387759337.1818
 You have employed your time much better	52045452.66341546
 No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting	2846495398320030.0
 We neither of us perform to strangers	47683700.20800683
"  Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of	2.1076246696278147e+19
 Elizabeth immediately began playing again	506779.24069699005
 Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy,  "Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master	1.3343075983102849e+41
 Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn	3455031156832296.0
"  Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation	2.6714768134393713e+69
  Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste	1.295976874700188e+18
 Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home	6.73742423883234e+31
     CHAPTER IX	741.3199562126512
   Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs	4.029526068251747e+16
 Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor	9.78817780254113e+27
 As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr	3.645109644294765e+47
 Darcy, and Mr	110107.4270385854
 Darcy only, entered the room	7455403.978366814
  He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within	9.057961616461361e+28
  They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence	1.1509921824618622e+22
 It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,  "How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr	1.6182175958951789e+59
 Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr	4291155656854.52
 Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before	2.4174208256776075e+23
 He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London	542838140580952.25
"  "Perfectly so--I thank you	8131871.4294919055
"  She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added,  "I think I have understood that Mr	3.05441154222865e+27
 Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"  "I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future	4.658205702761235e+37
 He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing	1.8254325806622353e+20
"  "If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there	6.007812973023673e+37
 But perhaps Mr	8294.665447992687
 Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle	8.507637615980885e+32
"  "I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers	2.26928366286202e+28
"  Elizabeth made no answer	734455.7845611725
 She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him	1.4842426958574417e+31
  He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house	3.329353241663673e+17
 Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr	504406358881051.75
 Collins first came to Hunsford	627667.5137404491
"  "I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object	2.2627668325913581e+21
"  "Mr	10876.835996291326
"  "Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had	5.342109604200975e+36
 My friend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr	2.6034366704878696e+16
 Collins as the wisest thing she ever did	534399779.44109446
 She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her	3.2277864327616387e+22
"  "It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends	2.4284494105095048e+23
"  "An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles	2174536281404782.0
"  "And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey	1.7105818593989496e+18
 Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance	451914776871.01953
"  "I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match," cried Elizabeth	3.138958446385291e+23
 "I should never have said Mrs	70517289.17591846
"  "It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire	4996043199040.475
 Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far	3498983987201656.5
"  As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,  "I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family	3.09419426964305e+54
 The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances	2742980616391575.5
 Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil	2.2309740297807696e+16
 But that is not the case _here_	5977286507.7699795
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance	2.5688420461580554e+39
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment	2.0161486004344374e+26
 _You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn	4937428987.109612
"  Elizabeth looked surprised	76322.32858955198
 The tête-à-tête surprised them	67427.94043591528
 Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away	5.5963149460008e+28
 "My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way	1.63115094552957e+24
"  But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year	1.3544781583448588e+60
 Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day	1.318794483295335e+62
 They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt	1.8845760222942075e+23
 It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind	inf
  But why Mr	8288.482487711943
 Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand	410858543521019.2
 It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself	2.813089676634516e+44
 He seldom appeared really animated	451682.8261174642
 Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out	9.92799397990208e+61
--She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success	1.4448601690885646e+22
 He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable	3.3517800131459584e+18
 It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind	1.6391593501927965e+29
  She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs	1.5197529272220887e+27
 Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power	2.308136073235684e+52
  In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam	273249185075649.12
 He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr	1.3465214010773914e+30
 Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all	2.851578628858417e+16
   More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr	3224874296792274.5
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers	3.388226165115679e+44
--How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third	2.426289559994838e+20
 It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her	2.3175011580790013e+43
 He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr	1.1893707742330175e+57
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too	5.413083403851744e+35
 His words seemed to imply it	7969500.456192703
 Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter	7.54867335532803e+29
 It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage	1.942373858297451e+23
  She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr	5.230992803329556e+38
 Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her	36525009831413.88
"  "I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage	1.4819566445514214e+35
 Are you going much farther?"  "No, I should have turned in a moment	3.765083843656054e+17
"  And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together	370340266643857.3
  "Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she	3686014612023.5435
  "Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again	5349221018.52753
 But I am at his disposal	6574722.545146792
 He arranges the business just as he pleases	576025834.8018969
 I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr	1.562548418042563e+20
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
"  "He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam	3.7459852508941416e+16
 It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor	1.3670179300364181e+25
 I speak feelingly	9588.385205062326
 A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence	481326155827749.0
"  "In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either	3.7361312228230395e+18
 Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"  "These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature	7.821411813001208e+56
 But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money	2824512375455952.5
 Younger sons cannot marry where they like	45078607.62564198
"  "Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do	2.8209095251226368e+17
"  "Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money	5.205379869762867e+30
"  "Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds	9.202033546361813e+64
"  He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped	49481431321819.61
 To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,  "I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal	2.548114343328473e+40
 I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind	2915985032339772.0
 But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her	1.8571593859625184e+30
"  "No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me	3.435104452338083e+20
 I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy	503007653921.768
"  "Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way	1.834889689248791e+55
"  As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth	2.1513119789388712e+46
 She directly replied,  "You need not be frightened	51590655013.28026
 I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world	2.442509665936171e+23
 She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs	393873922522430.94
 Hurst and Miss Bingley	77213.81662331533
"  "I know them a little	81855382.64230965
"  "Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr	77267156590.83511
 Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr	6336237.973814714
 Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him	621819673777.3384
"  "Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care	1.2749702845116193e+25
 From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him	1.6112115574328988e+22
 But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant	2.538079901220372e+21
 It was all conjecture	78537.30130073706
"  "What is it you mean?"  "It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing	5.956047680228327e+43
"  "You may depend upon my not mentioning it	49009156674.37007
"  "And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley	4.607185444782832e+16
 What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	2.478929069532529e+72
"  "Did Mr	99251.27303390749
 Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"  "I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady	1.2484742569176982e+23
"  "And what arts did he use to separate them?"  "He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling	1.3990429459064625e+29
 "He only told me, what I have now told you	5302074985974.385
"  Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation	4856126955408592.0
 After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful	420851383003976.06
  "I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she	4856569640636018.0
 "Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings	3439546763.9139366
 Why was he to be the judge?"  "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"  "I do not see what right Mr	1.1559139597973656e+29
 Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy	7.145897553751756e+35
" "But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him	3.0003694150025974e+27
"  "That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly	1.778235918179724e+26
"  This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr	4.7251949771362944e+17
 Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage	8.744132264961986e+29
 There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard	1.431917851008951e+27
 It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected	2.0350460522044768e+20
 There could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr	3883516193181222.5
 Darcy could have such boundless influence	6769486.209399766
 That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr	3778238575371.7188
 Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them	1.7974994206017436e+24
 If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer	1.3238468721844491e+38
 He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted	5.405166165075209e+33
  "There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London	2.9117596522194284e+41
  "To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection	4.8183574904170234e+17
 All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating	1.873655924431982e+20
 Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr	2.140495760877876e+21
 Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach	231081132991324.34
" When she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr	9.654026067886542e+31
 Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr	7.667338526829076e+58
  The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr	1.0142324645593156e+32
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
     CHAPTER XI	744.2447302579417
   When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr	2.50432623677122e+19
 Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent	1.7605488929434434e+23
 They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering	1.692996065002281e+21
 But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded	2.848286251090778e+54
 Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal	1.4438131115638393e+22
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings	1.8007830664640543e+22
 It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do	4.028971463857458e+56
  She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him	2.7856333883508314e+49
  While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her	1.3729271738092673e+52
 But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr	1.9205344664237819e+25
 Darcy walk into the room	655803.0713748739
 In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better	1.2936617485124478e+25
 She answered him with cold civility	5425971.040881862
 He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room	2.243528682138958e+16
 It will not do	86650.47356594136
 My feelings will not be repressed	5819298.646453756
 You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you	430171721538696.75
"  Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression	5207356.373092506
 She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent	61853431645.243065
 This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed	1.975068820632885e+23
 He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride	1.4663082231283003e+31
 His sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit	2.4045277273868353e+43
  In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger	1.4792585029281298e+60
 She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done	3.014143198237948e+19
 He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand	4.019709017449874e+43
 As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer	2.9334458842159427e+18
 He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security	2456692320286908.5
 Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,  "In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned	2.180800733708917e+56
 It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you	2.1030140068546698e+23
 But I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly	2.3415090456427003e+18
 It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration	2.91538388992843e+17
 The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation	1.6303906046585988e+27
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise	9.974692720313724e+26
 His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature	2.3741316075234806e+18
 He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it	3.186768065405535e+24
 At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,  "And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected	3.747436757177722e+53
 But it is of small importance	6654778.809211735
"  "I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have other provocations	1.2079255027919761e+67
 You know I have	91341.29002769907
 Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"  As she pronounced these words, Mr	1.1887191653344599e+62
 Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued	1.3544916574413927e+21
  "I have every reason in the world to think ill of you	56822201986359.7
 No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_	204624437293259.03
 You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind	2.6543183601677e+58
"  She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse	1.1928993170721556e+27
 He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity	374288319916.76953
  "Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated	46216874822283.79
"  Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her	1.8818490197516526e+25
  "But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded	2.9372933860258192e+20
 Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided	40090171492506.01
 Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr	2053324476824367.5
 On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"  "You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour	4.074579077650975e+59
  "Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"  "His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed	5.66101940928707e+36
"  "And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy	8226226471976.94
 "You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty	308757269951599.06
 You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert	2.271498077687907e+22
 You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule	1.7576960473678778e+20
"  "And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully	4.675557736683276e+43
 My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design	7.87224923337599e+57
 These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing	4.305050390856725e+41
 But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence	420884590.37869453
 Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related	5160568697.555388
 They were natural and just	689009.3648397719
 Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections? To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"  Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,  "You are mistaken, Mr	3.8516022567949837e+61
 Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner	4.047725083130789e+41
"  She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,  "You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it	7.783491339520085e+40
"  Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification	2.9481291675825072e+20
 She went on	8564.025826476689
  "From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry	inf
"  "You have said quite enough, madam	6631622700.281315
 I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been	2.7809607055284572e+19
 Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness	1.2292058651168535e+22
"  And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house	1.2210767961359497e+26
  The tumult of her mind was now painfully great	4522410422.342331
 She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour	1.5236806776961532e+20
 Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it	2.9364468204372895e+18
 That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr	44247355551.650116
 Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	1.766843748507082e+70
 But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr	7.31707125988343e+43
 Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	8.704320254426059e+27
  She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room	5.275889560749403e+31
     CHAPTER XII	731.6204861599343
   Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes	3.0257060276143857e+18
 She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise	3.118582301910447e+40
 Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road	1.1041443153851396e+28
 The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground	1.6064478038908058e+22
  After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park	7.098111498468684e+33
 The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees	1.2342199769835432e+32
 She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr	3.8441111736175093e+39
 Darcy, she was directly retreating	9242331.868766721
 But the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name	2.2211117697273578e+23
 She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr	2.509003857179532e+21
 He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you	5.179013347849948e+43
  With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand	4.4060984753945195e+42
--The envelope itself was likewise full	390455959.8736442
--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it	32926446741257.785
 It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--       "Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,      or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to      you	1.2122646754815032e+57
 I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling      myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,      cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,      and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been      spared, had not my character required it to be written and read	2.4332387029850588e+63
      You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I      demand it of your justice	1.0733614517260109e+33
       "Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal      magnitude, you last night laid to my charge	1.7754845616379547e+24
 The first mentioned      was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached      Mr	4.5788439062699505e+18
 Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in      defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,      ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr	1.401720165616052e+35
      Wickham	96.30085307271028
--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of      my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who      had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who      had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,      to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could      be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison	3.0288359173121134e+75
--But      from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally      bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in      future secured, when the following account of my actions and their      motives has been read	2.3360821482634273e+42
--If, in the explanation of them which is      due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which      may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry	6.272308396266077e+37
--The      necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd	3248586407673.225
--But it was not till the evening of the      dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a      serious attachment	1.7197619754637306e+25
--I had often seen him in love before	47257248754.64417
--At that      ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made      acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that      Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general      expectation of their marriage	2.758714920526305e+44
 He spoke of it as a certain event,      of which the time alone could be undecided	4.49409489125833e+17
 From that moment I      observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then      perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had      ever witnessed in him	6.069096039210264e+29
 Your sister I also watched	579453.3811042611
--Her look and      manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any      symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the      evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with      pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of      sentiment	2.226904685781908e+50
--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have      been in an error	2.3744891028225833e+21
 Your superior knowledge of your sister must make      the latter probable	288868074387.9196
--If it be so, if I have been misled by such      error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been      unreasonable	1.6039731156984052e+28
 But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity      of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given      the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her      temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched	2.9132117977214513e+46
--That I was      desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will      venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually      influenced by my hopes or fears	1.046797233908821e+31
--I did not believe her to be      indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial      conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason	1.1194919807819637e+28
--My objections to      the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged      to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my      own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to      my friend as to me	1.3502397711832953e+50
--But there were other causes of      repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to      an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to      forget, because they were not immediately before me	4.438098438955127e+38
--These causes      must be stated, though briefly	33717870090.940357
--The situation of your mother's      family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that      total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed      by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by      your father	1.9633627219070456e+43
--Pardon me	68695.97639456349
--It pains me to offend you	528174478.6157993
--I will only say farther, that      from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was      confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me      before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy      connection	1.8930013067933227e+46
--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon      returning	2.216877303479432e+28
--His      sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our      coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible      that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly      resolved on joining him directly in London	1.3441740103912393e+46
--We accordingly      went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to      my friend, the certain evils of such a choice	1.1731349292102907e+26
--But, however this remonstrance might have      staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it      would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been      seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your      sister's indifference	5.937167687849506e+46
--But Bingley has      great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment      than on his own	1.2494009162607917e+20
--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived      himself, was no very difficult point	3.06360861905362e+19
 To persuade him against      returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,      was scarcely the work of a moment	1.805357330213097e+22
--I cannot blame myself for      having done thus much	294054327418.75415
 There is but one part of my conduct in the      whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is      that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to      conceal from him your sister's being in town	2.1846797249800045e+44
 I knew it myself, as      it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant      of it	3.0289685009724225e+22
--Perhaps this      concealment, this disguise, was beneath me	3563400633409.5854
--On this subject I have nothing more      to say, no other apology to offer	2.959912158541828e+17
 If I have wounded your sister's      feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which      governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have      not yet learnt to condemn them	5.3064623419087784e+35
--With respect to that other, more      weighty accusation, of having injured Mr	5.196440046933614e+16
 Wickham, I can only      refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my      family	3.0896301661639295e+19
 Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but      of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one      witness of undoubted veracity	8.097823448528745e+32
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Wickham is the son of a very      respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the      Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his      trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on      George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore      liberally bestowed	8.208455511332626e+59
 My father supported him at school, and      afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own      father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have      been unable to give him a gentleman's education	4.381467274519355e+37
      As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think      of him in a very different manner	2.248614453992066e+23
 The vicious propensities--the      want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge      of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man      of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of      seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr	2.5222887486143454e+49
 Darcy could not have	85872.65694044963
      Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell	32167352232601.09
 Wickham has created, a      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his      real character	1.878647495577454e+18
 It adds even another motive	498041.710108052
 My excellent father      died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr	223259437123549.5
 Wickham was to      the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it      to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his      profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a      valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became      vacant	1.7127504366282544e+55
 There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds	5400325470.738095
 His own      father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these      events, Mr	1.73591183316992e+19
 Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally      resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it      unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary      advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be      benefited	1.4718452751130778e+44
 I rather wished, than      believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to      accede to his proposal	1.946915518456168e+24
 I knew that Mr	86253.96163059055
 Wickham ought not to be a      clergyman	61520730.99713809
 The business was therefore soon settled	6213142.480239567
 All connection between us seemed now dissolved	47280886.307361916
 I      thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his      society in town	2.8534775339691782e+19
 In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his      studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all      restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation	7.733101547583075e+34
 For      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the      incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied      to me again by letter for the presentation	5.736696465297419e+36
 His circumstances, he      assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were      exceedingly bad	3.1675754305426604e+19
 He had found the law a most unprofitable study,      and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would      present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there      could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other      person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered      father's intentions	1.489327086846535e+62
 You will hardly blame me for refusing to      comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it	1.8258701441249e+20
      His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his      circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me      to others, as in his reproaches to myself	2.1815346526083672e+30
 After this period, every      appearance of acquaintance was dropt	40022832816.43342
 How he lived I know not	6415158.068035803
 But      last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice	2225150642564.1733
 Having said thus much, I feel no      doubt of your secrecy	3453480147566.303
 My sister, who is more than ten years my      junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel      Fitzwilliam, and myself	1.7344721745806683e+27
 About a year ago, she was taken from      school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last      summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;      and thither also went Mr	4.1840567906638644e+40
 Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there      proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs	1.954205897517994e+19
      Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by      her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,      whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his      kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe      herself in love, and to consent to an elopement	2.024940121033507e+57
 She was then but      fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her      imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to      herself	1.3467229755889315e+33
 I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the      intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea      of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as      a father, acknowledged the whole to me	3.580917857925491e+42
 You may imagine what I felt      and how I acted	45633710537.01829
 Regard for my sister's credit and feelings      prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr	2.6394390903034365e+17
 Wickham, who left      the place immediately, and Mrs	65026306554.7608
 Younge was of course removed from      her charge	442093283.4955537
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my      sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot      help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a      strong inducement	5.2229918267431295e+32
 His revenge would have been complete indeed	47184634.73307963
      This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we      have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject      it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty      towards Mr	7.357353951358897e+42
 Wickham	96.30085307271028
 I know not in what manner, under what form of      falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to      be wondered at	1.044612428376085e+28
 Ignorant as you previously were of every thing      concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and      suspicion certainly not in your inclination	1.338998748372752e+26
 You may possibly      wonder why all this was not told you last night	26550217657575.73
 But I was not then      master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed	2.5672085859479347e+18
      For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more      particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our      near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of      the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted      with every particular of these transactions	1.3486752225020815e+52
 If your abhorrence of      _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented      by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may      be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find      some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course      of the morning	7.103518384297985e+58
 I will only add, God bless you	468682801.30014277
       "FITZWILLIAM DARCY	8672.150760361968
"     CHAPTER XIII	7695.846490956539
   If Elizabeth, when Mr	914327.8662231634
 Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents	1.2704209399115958e+28
 But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited	1.6216480331783115e+26
 Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined	46164257148.94777
 With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal	4.09503009045333e+39
 With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield	1.5063572077068728e+21
 She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes	6.4443520390966766e+38
 His belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice	6.42594753008991e+39
 He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty	2.1016719793293757e+21
 It was all pride and insolence	8919081.057701236
  But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr	432072849902.07776
 Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition	1.5252206817148903e+54
 Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her	54607134637.99568
 She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again	5.9332223527059824e+66
  In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	1.1406886307620557e+69
 The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr	2.168002611586107e+25
 Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words	2.1600459115389957e+18
 So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great	1.9648421290384762e+20
 What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err	2.4935462306322143e+54
 She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success	1.5180011673529965e+25
 On both sides it was only assertion	45918058.07261316
 Again she read on	73210.25839961173
 But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr	8.618848253524262e+26
 Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole	1.3415665262195531e+22
  The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr	43671516012294.7
 Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice	1.7832151178890723e+20
 Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself	2.64258280771247e+18
 As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring	2.9875151404559667e+21
 His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue	3.0768065820229784e+19
 She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr	1.2565156449091476e+26
 Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr	1.787078439607417e+28
 Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance	2768183107995.113
 But no such recollection befriended her	7322939.478213899
 She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess	5.079448413189814e+44
 After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read	2198651770091573.0
 But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question	1.9309801272427816e+72
 At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr	7.438933942573999e+33
 Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration	3.062374193731841e+20
  She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr	1.74403689978542e+21
 Philips's	87.53791360993088
 Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory	37104196534.15239
 She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct	1.8294170414181553e+22
 She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr	33943357356953.83
 Darcy--that Mr	1065.919152299287
 Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week	1.201520341049217e+27
 She remembered also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr	1.784832327987985e+49
 Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son	2.013776838338123e+21
  How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing	1.4868422738877428e+51
 His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn	2.546777339951907e+40
 Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr	3.279834048103392e+17
 Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr	7166617952.175827
 Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits	9.360330004249453e+77
 That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling	2.351472041887717e+43
 Bingley, was incomprehensible	85213.51138507125
--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd	2.1326578106821807e+24
  "How despicably have I acted!" she cried	60093417572.301285
--"I, who have prided myself on my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust	3.549295100412739e+41
--How humiliating is this discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind	2.4098401671251795e+25
 But vanity, not love, has been my folly	52478700262.45981
--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned	6.145133516554654e+41
 Till this moment, I never knew myself	546247665.2086474
"  From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr	2.9298785225489444e+23
 Darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again	2.7911101017019668e+16
 Widely different was the effect of a second perusal	3929766507.2331266
--How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been	2.7338345603568405e+47
--Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane	35040495809869.152
--She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility	9.512187869739312e+33
  When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe	1.3563370135369708e+32
 The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers	1.4192797050063992e+49
  The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt	660609643852.1002
  After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	inf
  She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr	2.009648445805326e+19
 Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found	3.6056072569759165e+41
--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it	2.0427584112866783e+19
 Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object	45702330.25830621
 She could think only of her letter	71967208.20231108
     CHAPTER XIV	743.9554349255245
   The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr	428630820427.7531
 Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings	1.0367570901722674e+52
  Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been	3.6225630350399214e+47
 "What would she have said?--how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself	2.7503591998690284e+19
  Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party	60238972246.883835
 But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are	7.448748343905896e+30
 The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year	6.360657398602071e+26
 His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases	76158143.16023177
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	1.8545479434097603e+23
  Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,  "But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer	1.5466678200232063e+61
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure	4325904386932.006
"  "I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it	2.0789581170967448e+29
--I must be in town next Saturday	4771286215.589309
"  "Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks	3.383823404502649e+16
 I expected you to stay two months	56604672.589146726
 I told Mrs	8384.280878829788
 Collins so before you came	690887.8981544046
 There can be no occasion for your going so soon	40756146003.82957
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight	412788029.90671045
"  "But my father cannot	7509498.863692845
--He wrote last week to hurry my return	33577329217.65879
"  "Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can	3.117688368454092e+16
--Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father	4267006707390.8086
 And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large	inf
"  "You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan	1.8348191830978132e+19
  "Mrs	1017.6641180120203
 Collins, you must send a servant with them	5667958319.687238
 You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves	1.1133217844470617e+22
 It is highly improper	65221.69841227113
 You must contrive to send somebody	5214134.066515741
 I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing	49388482312137.375
--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life	1.4907074304279572e+18
 When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her	1.0224473616469148e+23
--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr	7292422932.93724
 Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner	3.289831731598586e+19
--I am excessively attentive to all those things	35422449848.48198
 You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs	47604626393.731026
 Collins	97.7243836727247
 I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone	1.9290139421512092e+26
"  "My uncle is to send a servant for us	478387578453.2133
--If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to	3.283249083767742e+16
"  Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was	2.573821539228776e+50
 Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections	1.8019821712843732e+45
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart	365960214028577.1
 She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different	1.608137369015094e+16
 When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion	2.488537507268945e+44
 His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again	3.8354429661723814e+36
 In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	1.3515060747890965e+30
 They were hopeless of remedy	590455.1740347102
 Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil	5.363203004672395e+40
 While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever	9.620520645513951e+30
  Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr	3415898612252.2495
 His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend	1.304293953351416e+30
  Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first	1.7265831448641906e+21
 The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh	5.594553590343255e+70
  When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both	1.5061846247982503e+45
     CHAPTER XV	736.8373587685448
   On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr	6508342.264590937
 Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary	7.980428715064802e+26
  "I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs	7734288695148681.0
 Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it	7.626673528978304e+30
 The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you	42358496188213.234
 We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode	225194399642694.88
 Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly	5.006484515060608e+62
"  Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness	475115696111.4083
 She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged	9.060976124865523e+32
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,  "It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably	1.225733907584165e+29
 We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome	4.1662440107384035e+53
 Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast	8.956889670452888e+20
 You see on what a footing we are	501036343.8383481
 In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings	6.357103808327546e+38
"  Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences	9.458355031421896e+33
  "You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin	2.2485894501312053e+20
 I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so	38516375980102.8
 Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs	5198066.479092786
 Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent	5.015631311040448e+34
 Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage	1.0907234897610536e+25
 My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking	370229976587584.25
 There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us	2239909234137078.8
 We seem to have been designed for each other	4080930780.8889494
"  Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts	7.09085610849673e+32
 She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung	2.8960037223322066e+24
 Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion	5.700920670838608e+37
 Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms	2.183408568503598e+24
  At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready	2.5511333475542855e+24
 After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr	2.8154033903347576e+16
 Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr	8.842219684168816e+43
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Gardiner, though unknown	76548.78103398884
 He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings	4.916474438825718e+43
  "But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here	9.291339827677719e+35
"  Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off	2.8977549856204293e+18
  "Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!"  "A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh	1.8638346317634637e+46
  "We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!--How much I shall have to tell!"  Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal	6.81795869171683e+34
"  Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr	8.847499077125399e+24
 Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days	368438960612.474
  Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them	9.921902862976695e+27
 But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation	2.7311965609923256e+19
  It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr	1.7512530791998872e+22
 Darcy's proposals	735.3770473438195
 To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther	inf
     CHAPTER XVI	749.1078607080937
   It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr	4.8924001036194275e+41
 Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs	1.117927960648649e+29
 These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber	8.638946410970966e+31
  After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?"  "And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there	2.5796706269270202e+70
" Then shewing her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet	2257853431255429.0
 I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not	2.6356184959961357e+20
 I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better	2.2323959234483586e+23
 Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight	1.01094569528627e+31
"  "Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction	487802336813426.94
  "They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all	3.561384641488494e+43
 Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"  "Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once	2.658488252419847e+47
 Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton	1.7845842238334833e+33
"  "Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to table	3.083827697630112e+21
 "What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like	1.661399699723314e+23
"  Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay	2.8950372995023995e+19
 Lydia laughed, and said,  "Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion	2.938390676304281e+17
 You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say	8.580451715638912e+27
 But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone	35492686166590.11
 I never saw such a long chin in my life	55234496996.833115
 Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it? There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King	5.4902107942643e+32
 There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay	3.905298218401441e+17
 Wickham is safe	7252.816709496716
"  "And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune	1.7387824515474763e+21
"  "But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane	3.076475371994528e+17
  "I am sure there is not on _his_	578790958660.2031
 Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?"  Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!  As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it	inf
  "How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia	595888688311.9569
 "I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home	5.686668558408095e+39
 And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away	2.7439170712401605e+20
 Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back	7.229184753347888e+30
 Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare	336468865108.2397
 She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think	3.448433247801347e+35
 She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr	449753530.6237505
 Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it	3.2066731819366016e+17
 Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls	2.2546911559426374e+25
 Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's	2.3601306281236867e+17
 Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col	5.939993466443471e+71
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least	2.4199530558879903e+58
 Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs	41556442919.608086
 Forster	92.27093135200724
 I thought I should have died	6481819.879370083
 And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter	2.461762747787562e+20
"  With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn	9.747995330452478e+32
  Their reception at home was most kind	46116529.80296294
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr	2.1785778300178394e+17
 Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,  "I am glad you are come back, Lizzy	3.679222177670163e+16
"  Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs	8.109107375668983e+51
 And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach	1.3728722671402845e+21
 I was ready to die of laughter	59501297.66197196
 And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"  To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures	1.3995788567777105e+52
 They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds	374824522427.0768
"  But of this answer Lydia heard not a word	50267519852.076805
 She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all	1.8869350793269104e+20
  In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme	7.04748848327336e+29
 It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers	1.749123815093538e+26
 She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	2.9861469137671044e+16
 The comfort to _her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression	3.274979412739618e+17
 In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account	2.053272537497757e+25
  She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents	4.519679306242669e+35
 Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	5.309763124502079e+42
     CHAPTER XVII	754.9460276189992
   Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr	1.936106723528556e+50
 Darcy and herself	9306.955233240773
  Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings	3.9462665459382764e+29
 Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him	3.668157679633891e+32
  "His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment	1.121401050771141e+33
"  "Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me	9.972962767882588e+30
 You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"  "Blame you! Oh, no	3.279726008256981e+20
"  "But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham	35425733442429.28
"  "No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did	3474358571239701.5
"  "But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day	3.2306344662805795e+21
"  She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham	1.794659882188952e+21
 What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual	5.20531316649658e+37
 Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery	2.2257218379050665e+18
 Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other	1.867941352421024e+22
  "This will not do," said Elizabeth	8175940619.476601
 Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one	4099438620850.081
 There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much	9.288736579944055e+30
 Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse	5855715319.104617
"  It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane	5.208919519589959e+16
  "I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she	4901721710319555.0
 "Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief	314984198962.49207
 And poor Mr	8934.409677562637
 Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered	3407984980010.523
 Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing	9.167661973148867e+29
 I am sure you must feel it so	583335648.0487232
"  "Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both	1.9309015438125719e+21
 I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent	1.3991951173453657e+20
 Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather	1.4618244991970185e+24
"  "Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner	1.313169702216114e+24
"  "There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men	3.1869625455350456e+16
 One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it	4821369049200674.0
"  "I never thought Mr	8461849.030456305
 Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do	4207935116990768.5
"  "And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason	1.9268053555945752e+22
 It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind	2.453651820243639e+21
"  "Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now	2.409316401753066e+24
"  "Indeed I could not	8912046.473008862
 I was uncomfortable enough	74937.93511564018
 I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy	5570373246.759348
 And with no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"  "How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr	1.449907330025422e+63
 Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved	491399016870.0697
"  "Certainly	9847.741588733596
 But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging	2.056851519112205e+20
 There is one point, on which I want your advice	421940061360.9654
 I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character	1.4503577301734882e+21
"  Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully	1.400106760604718e+22
 What is your own opinion?"  "That it ought not to be attempted	3767122288936211.5
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public	35532057581.58259
 On the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr	3.5664868472956686e+46
 Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light	1.4837629810873914e+28
 I am not equal to it	7982563.483877352
 Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is	2.0619951702291848e+20
 Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before	2.0976586830001677e+22
 At present I will say nothing about it	533430867.76397437
 To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever	328471404295.0061
 He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character	3.3958666327955776e+17
 We must not make him desperate	5586783.255343808
"  The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation	488902503141.04895
 She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either	8.072718001458339e+36
 But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure	510907539397859.56
 She dared not relate the other half of Mr	5202875199.050692
 Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend	2.0432563379297373e+17
 Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery	4.248194595822737e+34
 "And then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself	6.686743569018258e+36
 The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"  She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits	3.340850613819731e+36
 Jane was not happy	81445.4757462008
 She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley	3706117563.684321
 Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity	inf
  "Well, Lizzy," said Mrs	900733787.5621699
 Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody	8.218227804226323e+33
 I told my sister Philips so the other day	4666650603.672469
 But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London	331869150580762.8
 Well, he is a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now	1.3981806441311132e+27
 There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know	1.5580641817117164e+28
"  "I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more	3427398748785404.0
"  "Oh, well! it is just as he chooses	6774689275740.799
 Nobody wants him to come	603579.6199477274
 Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it	1.5862873967753894e+27
 Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done	1.319097224564947e+28
"  But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer	2.7845136558635568e+17
  "Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last	1.6674450839427255e+34
 And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say	2.3545645741959757e+18
 If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough	358376606892548.8
"  "No, nothing at all	92104420.55963384
"  "A great deal of good management, depend upon it	4351608133223.179
 Yes, yes	8856.800090741526
 _They_ will take care not to outrun their income	438610701152.2498
 _They_ will never be distressed for money	4481485564.490146
 Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead	1.6001114522315135e+26
 They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens	2.744200631925683e+16
"  "It was a subject which they could not mention before me	49716944769114.23
"  "No	10748.454751648054
 It would have been strange if they had	573832002.3988173
 But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves	37350649397475.96
 Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better	2.8526254611716306e+21
 _I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	3180722679785009.5
"     CHAPTER XVIII	7646.664244928084
   The first week of their return was soon gone	4802957623.6350565
 The second began	7962.020029619598
 It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace	3.836403866292775e+22
 The dejection was almost universal	582482.064436663
 Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family	8.054735484414776e+30
  "Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe	1.861416782677548e+27
 "How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?"  Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago	2.6566107925238365e+35
  "I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away	2.3177919566254426e+22
 I thought I should have broke my heart	495723879.6814962
"  "I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia	3854340644934167.5
  "If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs	4116394539809.9004
 Bennet	101.78305820814953
  "Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable	3.0513476934591644e+16
"  "A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever	533554423455.00214
"  "And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good," added Kitty	2.2529378811605792e+23
  Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house	44965934205.52153
 Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame	2.3098039791357446e+17
 She felt anew the justice of Mr	78356191.13692363
 Darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend	1.683184112160104e+22
  But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs	1.442892277316025e+18
 Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton	5.323579251495539e+16
 This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married	31881330543934.105
 A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_	5.0751122848192144e+33
  The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs	5910552011903.246
 Forster, the delight of Mrs	8122995.500867136
 Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	5.962730953424706e+51
 Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia," said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend	2.0866929077789927e+26
 I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older	2.2428149354039414e+23
"  In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned	3.527654456699746e+17
 As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go	2.184768161944205e+66
 She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs	2.0303435785317174e+27
 Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home	9.96426410449602e+26
 He heard her attentively, and then said,  "Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances	1.6129774091070988e+49
"  "If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair	1.8553645943398128e+53
"  "Already arisen!" repeated Mr	528121280.242978
 Bennet	101.78305820814953
 "What, has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down	1.248781671819848e+22
 Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret	3.2797146750653145e+19
 Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly	1.5035120508075657e+19
"  "Indeed you are mistaken	7350483.706345593
 I have no such injuries to resent	75110835.93022497
 It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining	5.0018692377636776e+16
 Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character	9.164155658885404e+27
 Excuse me--for I must speak plainly	5487884.8684904855
 If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment	1.2983788752639202e+45
 Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous	1.708023048114461e+26
 A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite	1.0857920758423622e+50
 She will follow wherever Lydia leads	4315869.207659552
 Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"  Mr	2.3758425291518462e+48
 Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly sisters	5.886416875713022e+34
 We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton	234456999006748.7
 Let her go then	72569.51238794763
 Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body	8.630223861971974e+31
 Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance	2.734527559624624e+16
 At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life	2.1964257043688645e+24
 It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them	5.248601395069628e+18
 She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition	1.632508983614442e+28
  Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility	1.1697057309824368e+26
 In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness	277997797751806.0
 She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers	3.2494229982836793e+19
 She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown	5.029187171428259e+18
 She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once	2.586150602059116e+54
  Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same	3.261937517774955e+42
 Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself	1.2012318604794207e+22
  But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home	9.287039501126076e+24
 Wickham for the last time	735389.4555516774
 Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so	1.1085387741504928e+24
 In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her	2.453063372796817e+49
 She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	1.8035717927492172e+67
  On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr	1.0303697011081092e+60
  He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him	2.9984202066325175e+45
 With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you say that he was at Rosings?"  "Nearly three weeks	1.0789067312627794e+27
"  "His manners are very different from his cousin's	46178360075.07923
"  "Yes, very different	8409325.199112382
 But I think Mr	87609.34236458936
 Darcy improves on acquaintance	61136.57577168743
"  "Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her	3687297640511627.5
 "And pray may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style? for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials	7.55187310059301e+63
 "In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was	5254040077040195.0
"  While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning	1.1261290890262313e+23
 There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,  "When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood	1.1110503534360239e+60
"  Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,  "You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr	2.2217404757275353e+52
 Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right	8.067601615761934e+25
 His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by	1.8743069546404835e+35
 I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe	1.2558187567941315e+41
 His fear of her, has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart	6.343805287615151e+46
 She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him	2.030037647815074e+25
 The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again	2.499474751736459e+46
  When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs	42076526895.80544
 Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning	2573835182858049.0
 The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic	4158554270157.0825
 Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy	2.8186509411294643e+17
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her	1.9529011834528104e+47
 Respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown	1.8167492340741513e+21
 But Mr	977.3026015898056
 Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice	2.824385468868769e+36
 He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments	3.142026356554105e+19
 To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement	2.336459570195607e+21
  Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband	3.3224813873242173e+18
 She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible	8.365786997581464e+62
 But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	1.8676436138873783e+65
  When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment	1.3947186804340346e+21
 Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp	inf
 Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself	4.358530589172956e+42
 It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment	1.4396436332048206e+50
 Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect	2.3064055399083063e+53
  "But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for	5.935063869120938e+18
 Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain	351931175549.6633
 But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized	1.0028985390548167e+29
 A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation	5.490970968664065e+28
"  When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short	7.526285628333085e+32
 Those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs	2.5121832358759187e+73
 Forster called her, and they were going to the camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public	4.5502174450243847e+46
  After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn	1.6289553302232068e+22
 Everything wore a happier aspect	549768.3893470534
 The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose	1.1238230461636168e+21
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton	5.640223800608621e+80
  The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs	6.71883507930454e+29
 Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent	3140761708983.028
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire	inf
 In that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs	2.9592314643435435e+23
 Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction	45150979.41473067
 The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak	5.285108308737466e+48
 But it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again	3.166543371990513e+21
  With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected	402727741113.9746
 It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner	2.938751392712918e+16
 "But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me	2.5834306895853057e+29
"  The period of expectation was now doubled	710634223.7770926
 Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival	2471124711161.5312
 But they did pass away, and Mr	667362054.8914142
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn	33495957238046.63
 The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them	5.665962726944234e+61
 One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad	3.2485333490160345e+37
  It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c	1.053943152541895e+41

 To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs	624182172627.9989
 Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated	9.366866318807383e+47
 It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it	2.4381603936005386e+18
 In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs	42663184274.05849
 Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again	4063412023.044021
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation	40379179676189.41
  "My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt	2.656037913374787e+24
 "A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected	397398907806388.0
 Wickham passed all his youth there, you know	5346291301.469341
"  Elizabeth was distressed	85547.98922867824
 She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it	2.548441594675018e+20
 She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains	1.2928997132623915e+28
 Gardiner abused her stupidity	76957.20995337151
 "If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful	1.9203082180042476e+29
 The possibility of meeting Mr	732954.0537494909
 Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred	4941669530.35543
 It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk	1.0075970205486763e+31
 But against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered	1.4434286572895927e+35
 A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme	8.569523652132023e+68
  To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go	8176287222.182209

     CHAPTER I	953.5291521241652
   Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter	4.607984518520622e+36
  The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground	3558240591562.832
 They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent	1.2151760419045499e+25
  Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view	1.3440447382782868e+20
 They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound	1.0540895089444174e+51
 It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance	4.096966212558726e+43
 Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned	3519965576.1754937
 Elizabeth was delighted	8518.579494708067
 She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste	6.497951272196084e+25
 They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!  They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned	9.990000153655546e+59
 She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken	510388623.4297704
 On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was	1.0537412402884777e+34
 They followed her into the dining-parlour	6075165.865270914
 It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up	659111613514.818
 Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect	3812333876157492.0
 The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object	1.593164257203863e+24
 Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight	7.404703718564991e+42
 As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen	8.925773050743212e+23
 The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings	4.630709891898021e+51
  "And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt	2.1672063554715455e+55
--But no,"--recollecting herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them	1.0828338331132967e+29
"  This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret	3450449110826.2456
  She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it	2.1282870597000857e+21
 At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs	2.384423460639681e+22
 Reynolds replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends	2.7098887739324183e+22
" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!  Her aunt now called her to look at a picture	7.2119433358613195e+28
 She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr	6749973840.56
 Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle-piece	298365476581.2255
 Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it	539317780009.2947
 The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence	5.813569762016143e+35
--"He is now gone into the army," she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild	1.5483620197316487e+26
"  Mrs	1017.6641180120203
  "And that," said Mrs	106899455.56799732
 It was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago	34450564757379.047
"  "I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs	4010359949678709.0
 Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face	42914437828591.86
 But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not	406885203694701.3
"  Mrs	1017.6641180120203
  "Does that young lady know Mr	59765137.84773902
 Darcy?"  Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little	7345285943.437305
"  "And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"  "Yes, very handsome	3.255984003184398e+21
"  "I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this	7.747067026735082e+30
 This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then	1.4297891491681152e+20
 He was very fond of them	7216361.089041842
 Wickham's being among them	59318.3695227154
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old	1.4522666162906864e+19
  "And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr	478136871216193.06
 Gardiner	96.1567940983876
  "Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long	2.2026296930825845e+21
 In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him	8.956186912075298e+23
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs	2.2487502459246334e+19
 Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister	1.848180774415862e+20
"  "Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate	564427086994912.4
"  "If your master would marry, you might see more of him	440286703957222.5
"  "Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be	4.5916687189437984e+17
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Gardiner smiled	783.8155368436071
 Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so	3.313238215161593e+24
"  "I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him," replied the other	2.6572397221016244e+24
 Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old	2.39730111482031e+44
"  This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas	3.544311628950068e+16
 That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion	56747123540227.9
 Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying,  "There are very few people of whom so much can be said	7.551985317840177e+33
 You are lucky in having such a master	508882631.8922465
"  "Yes, Sir, I know I am	82441397163.77626
 If I was to go through the world, I could not meet with a better	4.46595104982865e+16
 But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world	1.0730226517398978e+35
"  Elizabeth almost stared at her	6665866.764206115
--"Can this be Mr	70316560.09900607
 Darcy!" thought she	805975.5128028034
 Gardiner	96.1567940983876
  "Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor	3.472715918698952e+23
"  Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more	53519201876110.95
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Reynolds could interest her on no other point	429463253.9203763
 She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain	6.18274031010241e+23
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase	2.227531161506115e+46
  "He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived	4.4187471822890526e+20
 Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves	352396560403658.1
 There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name	2.249085392407229e+17
 Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it	2.272581872986408e+17
 To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men	1.9730190208810016e+17
  "This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend	2.081212893240739e+28
"  "Perhaps we might be deceived	60601753.83233282
  "He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows	3.6421672186122574e+20
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room	2737820410497.9336
 "And this is always the way with him," she added	67698750603929.95
--"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment	2.710366846494037e+19
 There is nothing he would not do for her	6259097992.585613
"  The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shewn	2.9352476742297515e+21
 In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible	1.6246127107273522e+52
  In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger	1.940244931462081e+21
 Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her	2.6958396841889356e+16
 At last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr	3174525433495.2686
 Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her	2.7947758384252767e+23
 She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery	1.2530523013183614e+21
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time	303445794549415.94
  There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance	8.864871414320014e+29
 The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs	50678716.93057198
 Reynolds was of no trifling nature	5466019.894844757
 What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression	inf
  When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door	7.067057071248605e+40
  As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables	1.1293133679539786e+56
  They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight	2.788706116546625e+24
 Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush	2.063254094197171e+16
 He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility	3.186829807809852e+40
  She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome	1.1266722123284169e+23
 Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr	1.0862243658669737e+29
 Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life	1.1070301786083272e+56
 Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts	1.8795249988528826e+61
  At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave	7.360512751806041e+29
  The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence	9.539571471361461e+33
 She was overpowered by shame and vexation	51544341.53102303
 Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage	inf
 She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting	412321217194.2444
 And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting	1.7539038287514114e+56
 What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it	7.31250755861007e+35
  They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene	inf
 Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr	1.929010900239832e+20
 Darcy then was	8941.351428937065
 She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him	1.3252973574687997e+37
 Perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was not like ease	9.134114504089968e+29
 Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure	1.6771773691746816e+28
  At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself	1.4212263999060012e+28
  They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream	4.986831715250831e+64
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk	1.6754574260290523e+19
 With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round	3188411937718350.5
 It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts	7.120078590534383e+40
 They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it	1.393462181823713e+58
 Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs	2.1033677755210708e+24
 Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible	1.7926654124933813e+26
 Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr	6.680046507422202e+38
 Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little	4.743905374004238e+45
 Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr	8.685554955237726e+31
 Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance	5136133991.260576
 For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path	1.9935651369272643e+18
 This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them	8.893354630935762e+23
 With a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed	1.7071714327433087e+74
 Her colour changed, and she said no more	5929245847.003681
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	1.5058425202290481e+29
 "What will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion	1.5180375762899947e+27
"  The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions	3.865454156113753e+51
 That he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr	1.3020674297241047e+37
 Gardiner	96.1567940983876
 Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph	524282134678.1775
 It was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush	2.2071554061075966e+20
 She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners	9.69007624376525e+34
  The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr	443034690475.3227
 Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport	1.3413468671198798e+50
 Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder	2.347782361662368e+19
 Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself	3.223956344610348e+17
 Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened	2.3837624927383774e+48
 My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this	3069974512402.5996
 It is impossible that he should still love me	4815230445.532737
"  After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration	3.281035560939064e+48
 It originated in Mrs	75078.34265125122
 Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's	2.3032409032237716e+25
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together	39180265974058.58
 After a short silence, the lady first spoke	4995685416.850227
 She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country	9.122924177264087e+70
" He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling	5.302427986001076e+35
 "They will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr	1.4864919753238273e+25
 Bingley and his sisters	86105.82418272586
"  Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow	475979234.0631684
 Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr	377505160649.15125
 Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged	7.751413639293604e+26
  "There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"  The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it	4.829125793676916e+76
 She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her	3.032123803868222e+49
  They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought	31315377837696.926
 Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased	3778027943251412.5
 His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind	4.264915750522592e+16
 They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr	5736604792168401.0
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind	3920089189.03321
  He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn	1.8452004146357492e+22
 At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward	4.066899410678637e+16
 She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject	41728796399493.6
 At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance	2.4331747412597623e+21
 Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over	1.195483025540808e+21
 On Mr	955.4083335366394
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness	4.776644005088649e+32
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house	1.6010101238376725e+22
  The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected	1.2266788396578193e+26
 "He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle	4.030354640431791e+16
  "There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming	2.555182730030065e+33
 I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it	1.7579156421540802e+25
"  "I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us	47732908960861.35
 It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention	2.179513266816901e+19
"  "To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good	1.2775524417518277e+36
 But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?"  Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning	2.1403791210012447e+49
  "But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle	4.3203413287334035e+17
 "Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds	4.371062809276743e+34
"  Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing	387822953225357.0
  "From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs	5731410947813.2
 Gardiner, "I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham	1.0179034020337039e+30
 He has not an ill-natured look	5427316.727532973
 On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks	337302420057713.0
 And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart	2.222154115640736e+21
 But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes	8.775175324212711e+28
 But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue	2.82057646607759e+23
"  Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire	3.413787380961047e+77
 In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on	8.270733294723742e+37
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else	1.3093653492322152e+54
 Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance	2.7405073134309064e+42
  The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr	9.13848098431088e+36
 Darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister	4.164820925219596e+17
     CHAPTER II	753.0020911079799
   Elizabeth had settled it that Mr	7709429.843125799
 Darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	9.109216739886713e+34
 But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came	1.2501731550175748e+21
 They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street	1.5599742043248775e+57
 Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected	1.5508081400463198e+31
 Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business	6.324672246788293e+42
 Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece	4.478352728070881e+34
 While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing	1.7583053033051322e+19
 She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	1.1520883495794731e+51
  She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse	4.34952476611142e+42
  Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place	31128233330453.098
 With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself	2.2808320748910912e+18
 She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable	337615089734423.94
  Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful	2.153901536978257e+32
 She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle	1.2555743496648516e+27
 Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr	3.3373195509614305e+18
 Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings	4491378382437.378
  They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room	2.2650423145706157e+55
 All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again	2.1110400547625268e+39
 He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done	1.2872362647970765e+28
  To Mr	1082.6013904328236
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself	443288790610.37384
 They had long wished to see him	61164410.410455845
 The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr	524229138.05829257
 Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love	2.3551505377985447e+40
 Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough	1.7130976152005735e+22
  Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do	83130828133.34415
 She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	2.969097122100802e+60
 Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased	4675034069852436.0
 Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance	4.419305512134851e+36
 But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane	2.039560194960203e+31
 No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard	26948911785.15961
 Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister	3243490960428.7007
 On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared	2.558560356751725e+54
 He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months	3.5772904656844696e+60
 We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield	2.341745495683193e+18
"  Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn	8.300681234411547e+37
 There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning	1.781409515016547e+26
  It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr	4777877801798.375
 Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day	4.161447866507579e+67
 Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings	1.647306191266428e+79
 Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr	2662987122947463.5
 Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country	4.789115131325751e+16
 Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed	2.2782365129432223e+20
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head	6.250215665643116e+33
  Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends	7.700949993074108e+31
 Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little	1.7775034031379745e+62
 Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress	3.93621860896041e+37
  But she had no reason to fear Mr	621694735.8543992
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication	3397036442471.41
 It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr	480017442593.5006
 Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her	2.8441098718922764e+21
 They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry	425695245015.8851
  Of Mr	1073.2755382021412
 Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find	1.7522857305774755e+27
 They could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr	5.079842703027457e+49
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
 There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected	2.3503429402439896e+48
 Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight	1.2752968525936024e+19
 It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor	3.576349942408125e+20
  With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr	1.3537620390658952e+61
 Darcy afterwards discharged	6621.353958180717
 She certainly did not hate him	6063506.198492213
 No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called	1.1324106026122739e+29
 The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced	5.7570464862668396e+63
 But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked	1.7153281875134418e+23
 It was gratitude	8771.244841879185
--Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection	4.6540358895851404e+41
 He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister	1.3473985078095128e+69
 Such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined	3.5650762324704925e+55
 She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	5.430185956893398e+71
  It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning	inf
--Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply	2.9956128309497222e+23
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Gardiner left them soon after breakfast	4860781.34686214
 The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon	9.799165672425206e+25
     CHAPTER III	746.2740688337336
   Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed	1.3715917624403605e+52
  On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer	9.504003473841968e+22
 Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn	5.123073713580338e+35
  In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs	3.278106747659193e+16
 Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London	449222889244095.56
 Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved	1.3632207056284691e+44
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her	755819751645856.6
  By Mrs	924.9300363431022
 Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments	5.094110951164234e+34
 It was first broken by Mrs	6067896.460390006
 Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs	6.914254740715381e+35
 Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on	41789203022190.805
 Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard	5.17995382648411e+31
  Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention	1.5578439235548604e+31
 This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much	4.202768078317826e+37
 Her own thoughts were employing her	7442689.697627955
 She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room	35699009583031.1
 She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine	1.1248836847655959e+29
 After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family	4.6975014153260766e+32
 She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more	489616237560761.7
  The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs	1.3446998176913058e+46
 Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post	401323755882882.25
  While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr	1.672547009153995e+22
 Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came	1.2838272652571372e+36
  He had been some time with Mr	67418149.67830575
 No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room	3.712814481387071e+65
 In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr	1.838894405320881e+45
 Darcy were by no means over	5837408.392408938
 Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side	3.386113416189928e+45
"  In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	6.722145601111138e+55
 Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps	inf
 Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement	2714086452355.408
 To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own	2.458657270812561e+49
 He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend	2.7207334278254064e+41
  Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while Mr	2.6954867092243496e+16
 Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress	2.4843467417420035e+24
 But Georgiana would not join her	6041581.095173248
 Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable	2.669550938076667e+40
  "How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr	392538245424.75006
 Darcy," she cried; "I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter	2.0309781684595665e+24
 She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again	2.3454879550962808e+21
"  However little Mr	81759.63299282252
  "For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her	3.643253766448476e+23
 Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome	1.4678148940170889e+20
 Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines	3209718747260.2627
 Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them	8.665333121088186e+35
 They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable	1.7436131560939972e+32
"  Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected	2.534541965353399e+45
 He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,  "I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_ a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit	3.37864933115769e+74
' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time	2.018516489544126e+21
"  "Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_ was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance	5.153573527411029e+46
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both	1.4114002654022172e+25
 The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention	1.613559672122669e+23
 They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs	2.515133138546371e+29
 Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs	83720553.7968773
 Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject	2625381603299.1943
     CHAPTER IV	744.6392579075065
   Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere	1.6728672773829325e+75
 Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill	3202600993334665.0
  They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves	8.747363154506986e+30
 The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago	2.078115555235743e+16
 The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence	1.746136665927262e+42
 It was to this effect:       "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of      a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming      you--be assured that we are all well	3.5143712672836775e+38
 What I have to say relates to      poor Lydia	5142252508.731658
 An express came at twelve last night, just as we were      all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was      gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,      with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise	2.5930739344146257e+45
 To Kitty, however, it does not      seem so wholly unexpected	4181742930787.349
 I am very, very sorry	7641619.0047706645
 So imprudent a      match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that      his character has been misunderstood	1.73314959764996e+22
 Thoughtless and indiscreet I      can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)      marks nothing bad at heart	8.287726836690177e+24
 Our poor mother      is sadly grieved	3916288.755045286
 My father bears it better	583221.622802028
 How thankful am I,      that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must      forget it ourselves	1.111668560680997e+23
 They were off Saturday night about twelve, as      is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at      eight	9.474555594362898e+20
 The express was sent off directly	5227468.062311769
 My dear Lizzy, they must      have passed within ten miles of us	29689151991709.92
 Colonel Forster gives us reason      to expect him here soon	28234488136.43636
 I must conclude, for I cannot be      long from my poor mother	35600558478123.35
       "By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried      letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not      confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer      for being coherent	4.51580850942872e+42
 Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would      write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed	2.058448117004764e+24
      Imprudent as a marriage between Mr	5690157.603343031
 Wickham and our poor Lydia      would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for      there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland	5.526701849927303e+34
 Though Lydia's short      letter to Mrs	5618307.563303789
 F	89.99626846496759
 gave them to understand that they were going to      Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief      that W	8.965150324555697e+21
 never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which      was repeated to Colonel F	2.6160082206100795e+19
 who instantly taking the alarm, set off      from B	30748630167.30865
 intending to trace their route	509737.3168566274
 He did trace them easily to      Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed      into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them      from Epsom	5.130527863431566e+30
 All that is known after this is, that they were seen      to continue the London road	2.9613938950043366e+17
 I know not what to think	8050307.115511605
 After making      every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F	2455149656009.117
 With the kindest concern he      came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner      most creditable to his heart	1.9986104561011123e+24
 I am sincerely grieved for him and      Mrs	515739008.7831475
 but no one can throw any blame on them	3777869443.262257
 Our distress, my      dear Lizzy, is very great	49774485130.77677
 Many circumstances might make it      more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to      pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design      against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,      can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible	7.226229231482433e+53
 I grieve to      find, however, that Colonel F	57205894619.29434
 is not disposed to depend upon their      marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he      feared W	9.421850867363012e+23
 was not a man to be trusted	72418649.81447104
 Could she exert herself it would be better, but      this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life      saw him so affected	1.5214584698843847e+32
 Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed      their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot      wonder	1.0133814892945875e+21
 I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared      something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock      is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so      selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient	1.4928470986911234e+53
 Adieu	87.02025843845671
 I      take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,      but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging      you all to come here, as soon as possible	5.941944796527402e+39
 I know my dear uncle and      aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have      still something more to ask of the former	1.4596491969074654e+30
 My father is going to      London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her	2.7328031274814068e+16
 What      he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress      will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest      way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again      to-morrow evening	2.9141877656256124e+43
 In such an exigence my uncle's advice and      assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately      comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness	8.709857400000795e+31
"  "Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr	4.1892162531733596e+56
 Darcy appeared	842.4632220320769
 Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you	3.040173051102974e+46
 I must find Mr	79813.20278688293
 Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose	2.2127033981451203e+18
"  "Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr	3.834185420100942e+44
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Gardiner	96.1567940983876
 You are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself	543370657.7299379
"  Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them	2.28997876734827e+25
  On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid	4.766420065341133e+50
 Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very ill	3.916158758730643e+22
 "There is nothing the matter with me	650042190.4311764
 I am quite well	75918.09789602965
 I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn	1953061991433745.8
 Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence	2.432443281568717e+21
 "I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news	407388081156827.5
 It cannot be concealed from any one	52627419.72445396
 My youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr	2.726272463628779e+16
 Wickham	96.30085307271028
 _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest	473391160630.3372
 She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever	2.5601131041221637e+18
"  Darcy was fixed in astonishment	6814233.606458316
 Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened	1.3703858548500338e+31
 But it is all, all too late now	5917346843.836947
"  "I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked	722472982453317.9
 But is it certain, absolutely certain?"  "Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland	4.772647885207017e+36
"  "And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"  "My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour	3.9123304972534377e+49
 But nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done	3016515549297202.5
 How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope	1.5233390475702748e+24
 It is every way horrible!"  Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence	370448592501533.5
  "When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character	3857549751884.9463
--Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much	1.6567772960102518e+28
 Wretched, wretched, mistake!"  Darcy made no answer	408379657542.603
 He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy	2.581427755345158e+26
 Her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace	7.022751375396871e+25
 She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress	2.4190502834099297e+26
 It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain	6.557360462450594e+39
  But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her	5705312152885.528
 Lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern	inf
 Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress	1.2886479747496514e+23
--But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks	1.7774246226411507e+21
 This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day	1.5607515453351992e+20
"  "Oh, yes	944706.9906558864
 Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy	615224497569.1045
 Say that urgent business calls us home immediately	389299645.4337528
 Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible	38647927194.42101
--I know it cannot be long	574284309.9639788
"  He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away	2.907081920790855e+47
  As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination	1.8690689707645786e+76
 But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment	inf
 Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business	3.631110315335478e+34
 Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her	1.869196010196033e+19
 No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation	3588663239497184.5
 Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement	61591762375.91658
 While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible	2.4066912912407033e+45
 But now it was all too natural	60700903.29265723
  She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body	6.904358917191443e+35
 Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion	1.7947429837150984e+19
 Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object	3768290905476.145
 The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl	311892292008.857
--Oh! how acutely did she now feel it	331363885535.77277
  She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe	inf
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy	1.1843476300496268e+54
--Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr	42140941160276.62
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Gardiner could not but be deeply affected	49260969.66683408
 Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr	2.662280285042779e+22
 Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power	376087484.09796697
--Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled	4.780930150010539e+33
 They were to be off as soon as possible	5729657418.13516
 Gardiner	96.1567940983876
 "John told us Mr	611708.2347381801
 Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so?"  "Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement	1.3822998350376986e+28
 _That_ is all settled	7076855.261110007
"  "That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare	3.315144090519293e+20
 "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"  But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour	2.810050065478411e+48
 Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure	7.063119646886901e+61
 An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr	5045619277493.255
     CHAPTER V	742.8485262911339
   "I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter	4.1970810194815423e+48
 It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best	2.506895224849251e+47
 Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk	4.0148677140300407e+37
"  "Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment	4.563605425280052e+17
  "Upon my word," said Mrs	686303888.9263097
 Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion	547967198747.9244
 It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it	3.778478703409837e+22
 I cannot think so very ill of Wickham	553590034.1419648
 Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"  "Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest	1.7259490098887832e+30
 But of every other neglect I can believe him capable	38327742620.82855
 If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it	5042101043183384.0
 Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?"  "In the first place," replied Mr	2.6103063416866264e+26
 Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland	3087682975348043.5
"  "Well, then--supposing them to be in London	92869843806.58
 They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose	3.794125206582973e+17
 It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland	6.742952721302357e+36
 His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her	2.3567154470393142e+20
 Wickham will never marry a woman without some money	3537569443.4643545
 He cannot afford it	69865.19468556052
 And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce	2.0204543673863618e+75
 Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter	1.1508841569977798e+65
"  "But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"  "It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt	7.553849230876469e+71
 But, really, I know not what to say	77940639816.58014
 Perhaps I am not doing her justice	53337729.87626605
 But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity	4.033886063032385e+40
 She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way	1.7162411671786392e+27
 Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head	1.4707973865152417e+27
 She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough	7.244047408010294e+34
 And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman	2.499403459195838e+18
"  "But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt	2.80534547109051e+30
"  "Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is	1.8392566108554045e+52
 We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word	390008409515500.4
 That he has neither integrity nor honour	43402540.61316484
 That he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating	5956125173459.99
 Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	362286913361558.1
  "I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring	804095790190.008
 "I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr	556340755541329.75
 Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him	1.233635468642003e+32
 And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless	1.0085204460693646e+29
 Yet he knew to the contrary himself	56949091.40604731
 He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her	4855079290232055.0
"  "But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"  "Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all	1.4531619483396506e+37
 Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr	53715029538781.42
 And when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time	1.7827648764937522e+22
 As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs	1.494675476841064e+68
 Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me	3566777615822979.0
 That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head	3.3469193038077332e+16
 That such a consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts	2.0364874793139692e+21
"  "Not the slightest	901742.0993867291
 I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away	5.752883575140997e+38
 When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were	2.2790477994340195e+20
 Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites	3.845766012923928e+69
"         *       *       *       *       *  It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey	1.1519917983127071e+53
 From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent	45846959.58713514
 Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness	1.4709675007304173e+21
  They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day	1.6818079273824494e+22
 It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations	3.3792338840140815e+18
  The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	1.2388828490606136e+69
  Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her	5.059404290498448e+35
  Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives	1.1959433006784606e+31
  "Not yet," replied Jane	83649478.20838511
 "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well	3.102722938369483e+17
"  "Is my father in town?"  "Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word	2.654120245100593e+21
"  "And have you heard from him often?"  "We have heard only once	3.7073398123787354e+17
 He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do	1.304275698255379e+32
 He merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention	2.6962935939382575e+19
"  "And my mother--How is she? How are you all?"  "My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken	1.3683644064962552e+30
 She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all	405419034992551.6
 She does not yet leave her dressing-room	51634953.98337954
 Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven! are quite well	37910474405.0943
"  "But you--How are you?" cried Elizabeth	77124551061.40768
 "You look pale	74723.4779761256
 How much you must have gone through!"  Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr	1.3161948351048858e+33
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party	2.2048222032614633e+21
 Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears	2.6075645589859743e+20
  When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give	1.0302739748243956e+35
 The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage	2.421659490895022e+57
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
  "If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her	7.450109905128815e+44
 Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after	2.7642035519124163e+47
 I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am	3.344567964838344e+23
 Poor dear child! And now here's Mr	525709804.30410504
 Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do	9.895234434766337e+65
"  They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr	474010666659.8465
 Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr	1.5347347932531383e+33
 Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia	47101491.268612556
  "Do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain	1.0759400019887894e+35
 It is not quite a week since they left Brighton	38521085437.96256
 In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost	4.5443903053424255e+40
 As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done	7.556012368077771e+38
"  "Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs	555524433278.3923
 Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for	5330269563929.336
 And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry	1.2137538335748591e+32
 And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married	7.595484820194088e+34
 And, above all things, keep Mr	696180515.6280931
 Bennet from fighting	9501.708666683468
 Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day	3.478098897967258e+57
 And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses	9.676442852243046e+30
 Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all	3.508912344207427e+16
"  But Mr	10011.221026771125
 Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters	1.1678135751651035e+67
  In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before	1.0089520020498317e+28
 One came from her books, and the other from her toilette	4672941817355.532
 The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty	2.6782696060015817e+53
 As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,  "This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of	3.604383274967416e+43
 But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation	2.773506086347339e+24
"  Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	2.1821924037712294e+75
"  Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply	2.1258290830058624e+18
  In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy	3.5373813207696564e+39
 After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have not already heard	1.3989425473225359e+57
 Give me farther particulars	59559.91654080543
 What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever	6.203101260803607e+26
"  "Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm	9.829191701764035e+25
 I am so grieved for him	6515937.964541054
 He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey	3.5025395074398343e+40
"  "And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"  "Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it	5.337825747283269e+56
 He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before	1.2130114224796785e+27
"  "And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"  "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right	5.29830976909235e+67
 My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be	2.4147806647410696e+19
 Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step	7.827577631887709e+31
 She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks	3.5743042127158083e+18
"  "But not before they went to Brighton?"  "No, I believe not	5.201079757893002e+17
"  "And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he know his real character?"  "I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did	4.5456005914931515e+38
 He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant	515438903.0837919
 And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false	7.911027912335972e+27
"  "Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"  "Perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister	9.302051309637826e+39
 "But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable	1.5630238778368886e+21
 We acted with the best intentions	5143757.887360463
"  "Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?"  "He brought it with him for us to see	1.433699604604049e+26
"  Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth	666643092381584.0
 These were the contents:       "MY DEAR HARRIET,       "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help      laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am      missed	3.017764206337297e+39
 I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with      who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the      world I love, and he is an angel	8.50133913725993e+38
 What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for      laughing	253818705231198.56
 Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my      engagement, and dancing with him to-night	2.418489485391125e+18
 Tell him I hope he will      excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at      the next ball we meet, with great pleasure	8.108124042611261e+30
 I shall send for my      clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally      to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are      packed up	6.024842618259974e+34
 Good bye	765.4992683328314
       "Your affectionate friend,       "LYDIA BENNET	641134982.5240549
"  "Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it	2.6860578539562806e+17
 "What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment	523530239972880.6
 But at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey	3.5468406861745157e+18
 Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy	2.4629067238300736e+20
 My poor father! how he must have felt it!"  "I never saw any one so shocked	1.8778045448266662e+20
 He could not speak a word for full ten minutes	35382900665.44107
 My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"  "Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"  "I do not know	4.968877130513715e+53
--I hope there was	7335662.7801703205
--But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult	416370984768837.3
 My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties	3.1859499461627164e+48
 Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone	2.62925521721717e+19
"  "Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them	1.3880595714939014e+33
 My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me	9.818254600200816e+25
 She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us	4.448917771265036e+48
"  "She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours	8.795202858999794e+38
 Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable	79248852.85879645
  "He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them	1.037342334008116e+40
 It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham	4.562002639044993e+37
 If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach	3.3631393599256624e+41
 I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this	3.922889066506202e+42
"     CHAPTER VI	7604.240992600852
   The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr	479827156654.4382
 His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion	1.3104722561566398e+29
 They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain	1.4469745604716749e+29
 Mr	103.65865118859166
  When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr	9.707214552331751e+31
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces	1.4159266631399782e+26
 She shared in their attendance on Mrs	50489575.603194624
 Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom	5271607694178158.0
 Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them	1.6663351123753087e+53
  All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light	1.7626354850698417e+23
 He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family	2.3595960031729267e+33
 Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness	1.2626799381451397e+32
 Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them	1.7026469762570144e+79
 Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street	3.489282384470851e+41
 That Mr	1018.1240866328349
 Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr	7.395515861569486e+36
 Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings	1.5157096995781418e+24
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it	9.972907183334453e+27
 He added, that Mr	928075.7283495767
 Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon	2.9315052835454664e+18
 There was also a postscript to this effect	502583089.8165119
  "I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself	1.887489960408397e+52
 If there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence	2.028900464594775e+29
 At present we have nothing to guide us	480615592.2289175
 Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head	1.8860639978279505e+20
 But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person	1.1945288473678343e+24
"  Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved	4.4270623345777e+37
  She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years	1.4711347769205985e+25
 It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to	6.747692943340993e+47
  Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected	1.3577026058309862e+24
 The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience	26344173306418.6
 Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance	9.156022608082196e+28
  But before they heard again from Mr	55287076.09045194
 Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise	5.620608962587395e+43
 It was as follows:       "MY DEAR SIR,       "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation      in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now      suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter      from Hertfordshire	1.8235509678040722e+51
 Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs	6861527117.521715
 Collins and      myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable      family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest      kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove	8.379319500065314e+36
 No      arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe      a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that      must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind	5.92830434033653e+37
 The death      of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this	346292659116831.94
      And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to      suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness      of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree      of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of      yourself and Mrs	6.188549154948693e+54
 Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own      disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of      such an enormity, at so early an age	1.0288755575739299e+32
 Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,      to whom I have related the affair	3.2418941108230405e+18
 They agree with me in      apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be      injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady      Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves      with such a family	6.934336570949501e+41
 And this consideration leads me moreover to      reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last      November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in      all your sorrow and disgrace	3.9157381723462186e+35
 Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,      to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy      child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the      fruits of her own heinous offence	3.908503388515573e+41
       "I am, dear Sir, &c	6312856856.625775
 &c	728.1875560605945
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	9.870780082496926e+26
 It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living	1.0266719600902464e+30
 His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them	8.585245703587107e+31
 There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him	2.3867404004196336e+19
 And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount	3.1133168601776655e+48
 Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton	1.242881132356438e+18
 He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable	2.0289836371638413e+18
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror	1.4807055872455352e+18
 "A gamester!" she cried	90974694.85744166
 "This is wholly unexpected	639264.9918520247
 I had not an idea of it	79544615.79459076
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday	1.694962216505333e+24
 Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit	3.030821044031829e+43
 When Mrs	903.3580290211302
 Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before	1.1966915952784513e+28
  "What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!" she cried	4.173637187226402e+16
 "Sure he will not leave London before he has found them	3532350398007.708
 Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"  As Mrs	2.8896940021210782e+20
 Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr	2.250440025712057e+28
 Bennet came from it	77426.02031748246
 The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn	2.718082221024157e+21
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world	1.8366366880671158e+24
 His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs	2.218295884837346e+20
 Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing	2.831102282840288e+18
 Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley	32799248114313.93
  The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better	4.867041325730248e+71
 It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two	4743066723061067.0
  When Mr	943.2496258441263
 Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure	46597012781106.21
 He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it	6.775102568133684e+40
  It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that	4.8121973493279054e+45
 Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it	2.3503156747068367e+19
"  "You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth	456046927120745.06
  "You may well warn me against such an evil	36345923792.85335
 Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame	7.640681407302043e+27
 I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression	42072277990.210175
 It will pass away soon enough	5246549.123642045
"  "Do you suppose them to be in London?"  "Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"  "And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty	8.260616312460504e+38
  "She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration	3.662668380951951e+25
"  Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind	5.609736305771587e+40
"  They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea	2691599758393886.5
"  "I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if _I_ should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia	9.607465339598374e+34
"  "_You_ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it	9.708570272538189e+42
 No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village	1.8263924922030803e+17
 Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters	2798246024280452.5
 And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner	1.4562987618478223e+28
"  Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry	4.443483349094963e+16
  "Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy	5931530802056409.0
 If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them	2.003214313185657e+24
"     CHAPTER VII	7651.217212330928
   Two days after Mr	65692.71570129
 Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask	inf
"  "What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town	3204915573981605.0
"  "Dear madam," cried Mrs	735901133.6274041
 Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr	1.9881458227995316e+19
 Gardiner? He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter	2.7090192994003316e+16
"  Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech	3.200245013617658e+16
 They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said,  "If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse	1.2118603023949362e+63
"  Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	2.4713222549603934e+38
  Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out,  "Oh, Papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?"  "Yes, I have had a letter from him by express	9.931171121336427e+70
"  Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand	481088658.9191318
 Jane now came up	65102.73249710467
  "Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is about	3.0552379742692396e+20
"       "Gracechurch-street, Monday,       August 2	704569181.7852693
       "MY DEAR BROTHER,       "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such      as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction	1.338213524110907e+34
 Soon after      you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what      part of London they were	1.759519897408318e+22
 The particulars, I reserve till we meet	527113046.06359
      It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them      both----"  "Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"       Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both	4.534448827180428e+48
 They are not married,      nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are      willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on      your side, I hope it will not be long before they are	3.0328707910200034e+45
 All that is      required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her      equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your      children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,      moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your      life, one hundred pounds per annum	9.151329812681261e+59
 These are conditions, which,      considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as      far as I thought myself privileged, for you	2.036857827563488e+28
 I shall send this by      express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer	1.9743029212154499e+18
 You      will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr	485949317598.1928
 Wickham's      circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to      be	26570968906555.766
 The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to      say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are      discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune	4.105860646515957e+42
 There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming      to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on      my diligence and care	1.1475401280077572e+28
 Send back your answer as soon as you can,      and be careful to write explicitly	3.2861119989829204e+16
 We have judged it best, that my      niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will      approve	1.7165219420090216e+23
 She comes to us to-day	636937.3536401752
 I shall write again as soon as any      thing more is determined on	30413664598290.38

"  "Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished	525791140825149.9
 "Can it be possible that he will marry her?"  "Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister	1.8140233553653443e+31
 "My dear father, I congratulate you	703614090.1681938
"  "And have you answered the letter?" said Elizabeth	6800470459962.397
  "No; but it must be done soon	6319898516.75856
"  Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote	2.0359348997029116e+16
"  "Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself	3.877111388785336e+19
"  "I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done	5.040660530355799e+18
"  And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house	4.430787676960965e+16
"  "Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little	340248531010545.56
"  "And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!"  "Yes, yes, they must marry	2.23288664107591e+27
 There is nothing else to be done	61497993.66388174
 But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him	6.515083947893242e+38
"  "That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before	4.398842010699923e+20
 His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself	4.800903695236855e+32
 A small sum could not do all this	481910318.2101755
"  "No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds	2.959891918776767e+26
 I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship	3.3294691844334694e+18
"  "Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?"  Mr	1.1585949736330055e+21
 Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house	2.198600041515844e+21
 Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room	3.066917753291856e+17
  "And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves	3.373118036200982e+20
 That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!"  "I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her	2.054790567042571e+59
 Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced	6.810993125771291e+27
 How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"  "If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr	1.6259655905312522e+46
 Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own	409500721523251.8
 The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited	529128029801.57135
 Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge	8.295371287126441e+28
 By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!"  "We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy	3.1471307825743264e+67
 His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking	3.398135957311342e+23
 Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten	3.087024481272409e+33
"  "Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget	2.6688972264308827e+27
 It is useless to talk of it	71227028.79016843
"  It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened	2.0187826592704325e+20
 They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her	2.8607942538265125e+25
 He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied,  "Just as you please	3.3222954571950887e+19
"  "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"  "Take whatever you like, and get away	2.166706756147042e+23
"  Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together	2.673571726938387e+16
 Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs	55415660.51663575
 Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all	493481292581.2662
 After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud	36623590488710.07
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 As soon as Jane had read Mr	62669400.90827899
 Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance	1.2895721665748093e+21
 She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation	1.9194680018419036e+21
 To know that her daughter would be married was enough	54138663186.99015
 She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	1.8400592061521656e+18
  "My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried: "This is delightful indeed!--She will be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage every thing	5.2886585030430805e+42
 Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her	2.974913268941368e+20
 Stay, stay, I will go myself	664033984.5924469
 Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill	551364485.5569118
 I will put on my things in a moment	5045875109.781255
 My dear, dear Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!"  Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr	2.8632197577161486e+38
 Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under	4190001.6868087747
  "For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure, to his kindness	3.0240292319609032e+22
 We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr	329551379751.4324
 Wickham with money	7627.246270664329
"  "Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents	2.1464329092340936e+67
 Well! I am so happy	6468331.144205023
 In a short time, I shall have a daughter married	547939254992.1137
 Wickham! How well it sounds	7042910.413743735
 And she was only sixteen last June	54160378.673071235
 My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me	2.2538159763123647e+29
"  She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted	9.306068218766603e+49
 One day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual	1.2698788747167803e+26
 Other schemes too came into her head	42018585.85864824
  "I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips	2.691641915825806e+30
 And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs	414702817077491.0
 Long	96.05076188670454
 Kitty, run down and order the carriage	496102665.72700703
 Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill	2.064197563997928e+17
 My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding	1.1441407067308207e+35
 Hill began instantly to express her joy	41137315.53336314
 Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom	1.554567989638481e+29
  Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful	1.6866300921705441e+25
 She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained	1.7430090814263684e+50
     CHAPTER VIII	753.1610575185248
   Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him	7.054901770671999e+46
 He now wished it more than ever	53531731.5901733
 Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her	8.083963522985917e+30
 The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place	1.2647243696966826e+28
  He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	3.358641856469218e+53
 Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son	2.5820486258416814e+23
 This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for	1.0662661331039847e+33
 Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs	3.63118371834886e+17
 Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would	3208441224064914.0
 This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving	2.515125493456762e+18
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income	1.5166277254871436e+20
  Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs	26596437238.015984
 Bennet and the children	89521.10696088026
 But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents	2.72552579043767e+19
 In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him	4.247516304573661e+43
 He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement	1.0167791159856545e+33
  That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible	5.4053436475214244e+38
 When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence	8.498083015206481e+24
 His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution	2.041003530655515e+19
 He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any message to her	1.2197647046049365e+28
  The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood	2.758336495205737e+16
 It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy	4110610520.486425
 To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house	5.978855302142353e+40
 But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain	2.630943506997689e+57
  It was a fortnight since Mrs	6625251.561049835
 Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high	1.426721408753448e+29
 No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph	48024089647.72452
 The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants	3.6238249437498783e+51
 She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance	4.244543241425937e+34
  "Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful	3.49059560056301e+58
"  Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained	2770781008594732.5
 But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs	69991099523644.945
 Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding	1.766375808304028e+26
 Into _one_ house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance	398636413342928.8
"  A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr	39598152520.00583
 Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs	3886012644631.1567
 Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter	2.081621023376907e+22
 He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion	2.375581174273683e+17
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible	6.201914093597733e+37
 She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place	3.7398973420053076e+40
  Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr	2.7557460044308436e+22
 Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot	1.5268843181052587e+42
  She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means	4694158615472.944
 There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much	5.725504922217596e+36
 Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them	2.633044437509298e+28
 Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr	2.39973330752337e+19
 Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned	5.536695362707085e+33
  From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink	4728243815313.584
 The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this	1.4260788222945286e+29
 She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what	4.767314510954415e+17
 She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it	2.4610901576564946e+18
 She was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet	2.091813530940946e+21
  What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex	3.5289691593502237e+51
  She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her	2.5419328502993136e+23
 His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes	3.2106967104529736e+16
  But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was	2.166100490127207e+16
 An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family	3.102498435612492e+23
  How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine	2.817502843688443e+16
 But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture	4.190403205515251e+28
         *       *       *       *       *  Mr	4560066.336414754
 Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	53496473.32685405
 To Mr	1082.6013904328236
 Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again	6.54897683931574e+34
 The principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr	48534934612115.836
 Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia	44486540.70814688
       "It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon      as his marriage was fixed on	2.6706368349640107e+25
 And I think you will agree with me,      in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both      on his account and my niece's	1.0591159488948097e+27
 It is Mr	9607.051140870206
 Wickham's intention to go      into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still      some who are able and willing to assist him in the army	1.000595044253327e+30
 He has the      promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in      the North	1.524628883314462e+22
 It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of      the kingdom	3618045305683598.5
 He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,      where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be      more prudent	9.071916982796017e+26
 I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of      our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the      various creditors of Mr	1.7321647370187369e+27
 Wickham in and near Brighton, with      assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself	2.99800178283378e+18
 And      will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances      to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,      according to his information	1.1195310012234314e+29
 He has given in all his debts; I hope      at least he has not deceived us	2.194511904037203e+17
 Haggerston has our directions, and      all will be completed in a week	40795958186592.29
 They will then join his regiment,      unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from      Mrs	1.8353914347547722e+20
 Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,      before she leaves the South	3.4378885631146854e+18
 She is well, and begs to be dutifully      remembered to you and her mother	6123380337754222.0
--Your's, &c	5431736.72289603
       "E	940.0038684184688
 GARDINER	96.1567940983876
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr	1.5717761918824016e+23
 Gardiner could do	8033.614947313153
 But Mrs	935.8805876274682
 Bennet, was not so well pleased with it	7213588582.447159
 Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites	4.665721246680975e+68
  "She is so fond of Mrs	73933988.7776299
 Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much	1.6011530029677193e+33
 The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s regiment	1.8927508292134988e+16
 But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished	9.88830931488882e+74
 And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North	1.5718017619392142e+30
 When Mr	943.2496258441263
 Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn	1.1100080878787077e+37
 Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes	1.0604337392125364e+38
     CHAPTER IX	741.3199562126512
   Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself	1.6255339351891657e+20
 The carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time	2.7756657106227724e+23
 Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure	4.995733243458811e+44
  They came	882.0367395602585
 The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them	4617021890539.271
 Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy	1.4495493552563088e+25
  Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room	1.9020238653353427e+20
 Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness	3.0867402985147456e+44
  Their reception from Mr	67754.49789886673
 Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial	47155287953794.63
 His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips	31966621979464.48
 The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him	3753996186187289.0
 Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless	7151712848181885.0
 She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there	3.270498808342487e+52
  Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all	2.0001185325849094e+48
 Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man	7.808117679899876e+33
 _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour	1.5391208532853627e+25
  There was no want of discourse	6329180.365154789
 The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies	2.289724539574437e+47
 They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world	37718456546414.984
 Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world	1.2681939100225254e+27
  "Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time	5.8350568555914535e+37
 Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was	3.878491092169958e+36
"  Her father lifted up his eyes	54620250.35216753
 Jane was distressed	7899.047944492584
"  Elizabeth could bear it no longer	62347578.37072126
 She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour	1.352316604391999e+27
 She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman	2.371154158972738e+53
 Her ease and good spirits increased	5335629.337482585
 She longed to see Mrs	709999.4472672761
 Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs	4.1537055531138954e+18
 Hill and the two housemaids	838103.9925200851
  "Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me	6.2095052599005395e+44
 I only hope they may have half my good luck	36558736361.41286
 They must all go to Brighton	6426823.518408578
 That is the place to get husbands	61697117.53593362
 What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go	46902303644761.27
"  "Very true; and if I had my will, we should	585638631250384.6
 But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off	2.4098413518195412e+16
 Must it be so?"  "Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that	5.014370652986564e+16
 I shall like it of all things	64489923.37467272
 You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us	457812857317566.56
 We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all	8.362307566416059e+30
"  "I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother	416863162722229.6
  "And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over	5.665814657388573e+34
"  Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them	2977507113183.1807
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight	1.934458213707941e+23
  No one but Mrs	78542.8300700362
 Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home	1.2656466410189401e+34
 These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not	1.1305071522068145e+27
  Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him	2.0954225174973726e+21
 She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion	inf
 He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him	2.5844071254007505e+19
 He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country	1.4186668720384654e+31
  One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,  "Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe	1.0710069796695854e+40
 You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it	5.4637680043202176e+17
 Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"  "No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject	1.6392974183765684e+32
"  "La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off	2.307530487097369e+18
 We were married, you know, at St	6191947797.301592
 Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish	5126177925.289702
 And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock	46369478820741.17
 My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church	2.593676035099981e+21
 Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted	9.17825354017025e+36
 And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon	2.372289172240344e+25
 However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham	2.343881115906987e+25
 I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat	29608973637522.32
  "Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them	7.967061480529655e+45
 If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight	2.7937665244606826e+22
 Not one party, or scheme, or any thing	53839415258.84998
 To be sure London was rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open	3635471304595627.0
 Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr	1.7166189506815712e+25
 Stone	84.81803460668611
 And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it	4.3015875234486426e+18
 Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day	1.0151871376403838e+38
 But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out	2.2808616781008114e+19
 However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr	1.8048478576602514e+26
 Darcy might have done as well	6285467.174400978
"  "Mr	10876.835996291326
 Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement	5046087127.588113
  "Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know	75634259940429.86
 But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it	2.214834908579921e+18
 You may depend upon my seeking no further	353785883.7294576
"  "Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions	3.0555973123999938e+22
"  "Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry	3.208258980213512e+28
"  On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away	2.5257770474431735e+21
  But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information	1.4572300865972467e+23
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy had been at her sister's wedding	55792620.33492997
 Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none	1.8433863663573045e+23
 Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable	2.39367273397963e+18
 She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended	2.7231462412928034e+43
  "You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time	3.1783322952397813e+46
 Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance	5.7028039541453724e+38
"  "Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out	8.296926254488207e+51
"  Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante	1.9838560086382425e+43
     CHAPTER X	741.1941090933697
 She was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial	2.9975983991908976e+54
       "Gracechurch-street, Sept	100013.8227302378
 I must confess myself      surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_	2.2089469141849426e+18
 If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my      impertinence	3497641731606.7944
 Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing      but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed      him to act as he has done	9.883142659033034e+29
 But if you are really innocent and      ignorant, I must be more explicit	317670352574778.25
 On the very day of my coming      home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor	2.0202699046572908e+18
 Mr	103.65865118859166
      Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours	401934948980.0129
 It was all      over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked      as _your's_ seems to have been	1.5193947736002563e+24
 He came to tell Mr	754388.2705575463
 Gardiner that      he had found out where your sister and Mr	422692305425.25604
 Wickham were, and that      he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia      once	3.2218094348836106e+19
 From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day      after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting      for them	1.5031596891971956e+26
 The motive professed, was his conviction of its being      owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well      known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,      to love or confide in him	6.886304231250029e+40
 He generously imputed the whole to his      mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath      him, to lay his private actions open to the world	7.412680280947844e+29
 His character      was to speak for itself	60882600.978345655
 He called it, therefore, his duty to step      forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on      by himself	1.5869391161545274e+26
 If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never      disgrace him	2.895081684274566e+16
 He had been some days in town, before he was able to      discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was      more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another      reason for his resolving to follow us	3.202841527297465e+48
 There is a lady, it seems, a      Mrs	75791302029.09972
 Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was      dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though      he did not say what	9.371127860715571e+29
 She then took a large house in Edward-street,      and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings	2.0504918184788925e+17
 This Mrs	915.691628661593
      Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he      went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town	1.9228692635085607e+28
 But      it was two or three days before he could get from her what he      wanted	2.4152675532024972e+16
 She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery      and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be      found	2.685939879303836e+27
 Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in      London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they      would have taken up their abode with her	9.221312458271185e+34
 He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia	53010692585.76752
      His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade      her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,      offering his assistance, as far as it would go	4.651947004843943e+47
 But he found Lydia      absolutely resolved on remaining where she was	293732972442.0569
 She cared for none      of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of      leaving Wickham	2.420043952548298e+22
 She was sure they should be married some time or      other, and it did not much signify when	2.597919712399164e+19
 Since such were her      feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a      marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he      easily learnt, had never been _his_ design	1.2064710997609085e+41
 He confessed himself      obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,      which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the      ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone	3.99982779569139e+38
 He      meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future      situation, he could conjecture very little about it	2.2070713113242887e+22
 He must go      somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have      nothing to live on	2.307333867540947e+22
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy asked him why he had not married your      sister at once	3139442554456.3228
 Though Mr	929.6296477944919
 Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,      he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation      must have been benefited by marriage	1.3665906793540344e+29
      Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof      against the temptation of immediate relief	2.0768185630628983e+19
 They met several times,      for there was much to be discussed	3848960661786.1245
 Wickham of course wanted more      than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable	1.8545474344597435e+18
      Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr	44962207432.216576
 Darcy's next step was      to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in      Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home	1.2247189074195863e+24
 But Mr	977.3026015898056
 Gardiner      could not be seen, and Mr	765151161.7216756
 Darcy found, on further enquiry, that      your father was still with him, but would quit town the next      morning	1.81623011817106e+22
 He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could      so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed      seeing him, till after the departure of the former	6.53221137111699e+33
 He did not      leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a      gentleman had called on business	2.0640498893171714e+24
 On Saturday he came again	588741.8551288168
 Your      father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they      had a great deal of talk together	2.5819891045256244e+25
 They met again on Sunday, and      then _I_ saw him too	358207529596440.8
 It was not all settled before Monday: as soon      as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn	2.287575613828592e+21
 But our visitor      was very obstinate	5018906.021739722
 I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real      defect of his character after all	3.358755894837633e+16
 He has been accused of many      faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one	1.5453477923955954e+19
 Nothing was      to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do      not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your      uncle would most readily have settled the whole	3.8711335444720855e+42
 They battled it      together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman      or lady concerned in it deserved	1.9119810683806136e+22
 But at last your uncle was forced      to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,      was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,      which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your      letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an      explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give      the praise where it was due	3.5250947157643203e+77
 But, Lizzy, this must go no farther      than yourself, or Jane at most	3.450012811515653e+16
 You know pretty well, I suppose,      what has been done for the young people	3.3423405858087588e+16
 His debts are to be paid,      amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,      another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his      commission purchased	8.407530053813146e+36
 The reason why all this was to be done by him      alone, was such as I have given above	2.7715779326884263e+20
 It was owing to him, to his      reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character      had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been      received and noticed as he was	1.1335642642386471e+36
 Perhaps there was some truth in      _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_      reserve, can be answerable for the event	8.886600386238964e+30
 But in spite of all this      fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that      your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit      for _another interest_ in the affair	3.2406169887715678e+41
 I believe I have now told you every thing	5236813299.667336
      It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I      hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure	1.1406931310578086e+26
 Lydia came to      us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house	47343427380781.91
 I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,      representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and      all the unhappiness she had brought on her family	1.4057768038437845e+33
 If she heard me,      it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen	2.973139672348033e+19
 I was      sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth      and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her	1.8457976541829235e+24
 He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again      on Wednesday or Thursday	2.041974373343623e+18
 Will you be very angry with me, my dear      Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold      enough to say before) how much I like him	5.518446447224356e+34
 His behaviour to us has,      in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire	2.8894574599811342e+19
 I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever      mentioned your name	38022191095.31853
 But slyness seems the fashion	542301.9449992356
 Pray forgive      me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so      far, as to exclude me from P	2.1337008633989126e+27
 I shall never be quite happy till I      have been all round the park	293971551899708.56
 A low phaeton, with a nice little      pair of ponies, would be the very thing	2.6017764148323885e+17
 But I must write no more	6569047.437581626
      The children have been wanting me this half hour	3779353784.0506964

 GARDINER	96.1567940983876
"  The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share	6.87351786286372e+28
 The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr	3625793020411.003
 Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce	inf
 He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem	2128305759026383.0
 Her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her	5408609180415.474
 But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham	1.0208372969347438e+54
 Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection	33736846647006.957
 He had to be sure done much	67901790.09979632
 She was ashamed to think how much	65962897.07733715
 But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief	2.163447334512285e+17
 It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned	7.185573329787937e+64
 Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him	5.493892142649336e+24
 For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him	4983224732636.6875
 Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself	2.790355059930752e+20
 She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again	361107897851.4454
 It was hardly enough; but it pleased her	5689860124.966255
 She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr	4.670507513220669e+31
 Darcy and herself	9306.955233240773
  She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham	1.0817214464594946e+30
  "You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome	2.2227020791309428e+24
"  "I should be sorry indeed, if it were	659222952302.4023
 _We_ were always good friends; and now we are better	31823520285454.85
"  "True	9534.01175372269
 Are the others coming out?"  "I do not know	4688570053121.283
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton	52415004665.8557
 And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley	2.782991984881546e+21
"  She replied in the affirmative	7835739.3187475735
  "I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle	1.454941113191596e+31
 And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me	2.494795196176806e+20
 But of course she did not mention my name to you	503457155195.857
"  "Yes, she did	9841730.549230201
"  "And what did she say?"  "That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well	2.7162239403745033e+26
 At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented	4.151856779966732e+16
"  "Certainly," he replied, biting his lips	835438886338.387
 Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,  "I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month	2.044435389713707e+24
 We passed each other several times	4285187.396616634
 I wonder what he can be doing there	521224953.1909306
"  "Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth	3569645312208572.5
 "It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year	3.8196352221549816e+16
"  "Undoubtedly	9303.709151537449
 Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had	2.0676102464213343e+20
"  "Yes; he introduced us to his sister	56360761978.83034
"  "And do you like her?"  "Very much	7167699148316.741
"  "I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two	2.841474528525663e+18
 I am very glad you liked her	61279879.09104097
 I hope she will turn out well	54855417.499481454
"  "I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age	2.655482984302151e+16
"  "Did you go by the village of Kympton?"  "I do not recollect that we did	3.884204688878374e+20
"  "I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had	5.158971947804109e+17
 A most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect	2287154611748340.0
"  "How should you have liked making sermons?"  "Exceedingly well	325197640069619.25
 I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing	2.894342781919028e+19
 One ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be	1.103126588955707e+45
 Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"  "I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron	5.2110734264004734e+48
"  "You have	108905.5010214193
"  "I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly	8.306098255098008e+50
"  They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,  "Come, Mr	5.656067757784392e+48
 Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know	64943159764.90494
 Do not let us quarrel about the past	398755946.3511139
 In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind	4467289073354.741
"  She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house	1.146930157598209e+27
   Mr	103.65865118859166
 Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet	3.553348361278814e+44
  The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs	5423498170322.428
 Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth	6.202750738738763e+35
  "Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"  "Oh, lord! I don't know	1.6198513562841216e+27
 Not these two or three years perhaps	42871187.06414059
"  "Write to me very often, my dear	66377822625.21304
"  "As often as I can	82558599.42961799
 But you know married women have never much time for writing	325606286893.7439
 My sisters may write to _me_	536647923.82222253
 They will have nothing else to do	63157716.24754889
 Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's	3967419209.5523915
 He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things	418381444862.31586
  "He is as fine a fellow," said Mr	619587646059.7386
 Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw	5.4376782200240915e+17
 He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all	8568411575044.2705
 I am prodigiously proud of him	5961865.002310364
 I defy even Sir William Lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law	192240989241449.34
"  The loss of her daughter made Mrs	656150709.023982
 Bennet very dull for several days	4724603.311266032
  "I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends	2.838270894971454e+21
 One seems so forlorn without them	6248196.81941312
"  "This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth	5.265345639526202e+19
 "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single	29913633687798.715
"  "It is no such thing	81089722.9636738
 Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off	9.68315047317865e+21
 If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon	45288732656453.55
"  But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation	4.5336244570003047e+39
 The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks	6.90542113259389e+31
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet was quite in the fidgets	9119067.932390992
 She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns	398193840802192.0
  "Well, well, and so Mr	1036143693.811775
 Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs	531602360536.7927
 Philips first brought her the news	5745896.244546839
) "Well, so much the better	708230271.9557908
 Not that I care about it, though	738024562.8505601
 He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again	3.3062965584105707e+22
 But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it	4.5367316809705485e+17
 And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us	3039212589616715.5
 You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it	2.869991308730711e+16
 And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"  "You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs	3.349896327762007e+27
 Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true	7.0295224456940155e+34
 He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday	31792678578157.863
 She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed	1.0054819655955038e+35
"  Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour	3.1298260094422596e+16
 It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,  "I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed	2.506061238076371e+53
 But don't imagine it was from any silly cause	3537469743.388856
 I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at	3.056967397354394e+19
 I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain	2.354620796189164e+17
 I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him	2.2622505789883217e+20
 Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks	2.6496564308788764e+16
"  Elizabeth did not know what to make of it	71029841117.86853
 Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it	1.0391539409181997e+62
  "Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself	6.975025147738994e+41
 They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them	329437533081951.4
  The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again	1.008469438829488e+22
  "As soon as ever Mr	7725873.466983422
 Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs	6797234126.921859
 Bennet, "you will wait on him of course	62897093009.49169
"  "No, no	1111743.4920623302
 You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters	1.299887690773684e+25
 But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again	4.750801138054038e+17
 "If he wants our society, let him seek it	382869259714.38727
 He knows where we live	523859.3276116897
 I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again	1.0901383608919393e+23
"  "Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him	2.8241455622163444e+22
 But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined	2.844543779359049e+17
 We must have Mrs	77448.4092566958
 Long and the Gouldings soon	725727.219145819
 That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him	2.8632434185290112e+17
"  Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr	7.780995635283302e+30
 Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_ did	623221358387.3176
 As the day of his arrival drew near,  "I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister	2.2582138752695187e+27
 "It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of	1.2435476850020456e+26
 My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she says	1.3461466048518042e+23
 Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"  "I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power	8.783163706936524e+38
 You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much	1.6801494922408932e+25
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Bingley arrived	796.8476119413008
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could	1.185399704208777e+35
 She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before	2.3459251334553432e+19
 But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house	9.749819196978223e+27
  Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy	38881458658.767494
 Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister	535048412071.78485
  "There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"  "Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know	1.183967316403668e+40
"  "La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before	2.24411707664537e+22
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 what's his name	9231.975748103261
 That tall, proud man	679639.2604501387
"  "Good gracious! Mr	6936924.497476765
 Darcy!--and so it does I vow	9220425.992075514
 Well, any friend of Mr	8360103.311753408
 Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him	1.4709680906321956e+23
"  Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern	5258164719.559778
 She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter	6.439537939097851e+34
 Both sisters were uncomfortable enough	505660.46120502375
 Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr	3.0566461131697976e+23
 Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr	60345202071672.7
 Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them	42069072466.259384
 But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs	1.286765379319031e+25
 Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him	30299586578233.91
 To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley	7.603673466080397e+74
 Her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire	1.0425262816986172e+35
  The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken	4.396932677281627e+48
 But she would not be secure	7074407.422020849
  "Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation	1.85161451212082e+22
"  She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door	4.01807329649305e+39
 Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected	3770166255425837.5
  Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command	1.1832019205166923e+28
 She had ventured only one glance at Darcy	450970035.1027012
 He looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley	1.4303504849307617e+29
 But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt	2.9829010309317767e+19
 It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture	543579368034.9694
  Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed	1.4784167793444822e+22
 He was received by Mrs	747139.7273537811
 Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend	9.620177282368893e+30
  Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr	681415488.7194579
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing	2.5608208797975747e+17
 He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire	2.5559029389648265e+24
 There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself	545014037596236.56
 But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground	1.392943125951628e+54
 More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed	1.8673050426859712e+17
  "Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she	5739667384203.942
 "Yet why did he come?"  She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak	1.2219543672792637e+30
  She enquired after his sister, but could do no more	476732120250.2437
  "It is a long time, Mr	851700762.8011115
 Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs	62933515342.940125
 Bennet	101.78305820814953
  He readily agreed to it	703949.1110974397
  "I began to be afraid you would never come back again	4123388549040.477
 People _did_ say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true	1.5993937403684197e+26
 Miss Lucas is married and settled	5813318.4839125415
 And one of my own daughters	7300702.3024637485
 I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers	5.333125165655755e+18
 It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be	5.2054313048282984e+23
 It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq	5693587954338.062
 to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing	1.6795905343961315e+26
 It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it	1.4918781478376366e+23
 Did you see it?"  Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations	4.210716507503546e+16
 Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes	46673090.95538501
 How Mr	924.4387532309031
 Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell	6961356549.163056
 Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me	4046408911001079.5
 They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long	1.6583179749663795e+28
 Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves	1.7794710751842276e+18
"  Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr	769753744627.0415
 Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat	3.676389341005383e+16
 It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present	6.692389098776481e+37
 A few weeks, he believed	6716942.362485515
  "When you have killed all your own birds, Mr	454444135686.2244
 Bennet's manor	712.2187517960185
 I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you	3.46800499786656e+23
"  Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion	1.6459159558071114e+45
 At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion	1.2359975152631032e+24
 Their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!"  Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover	3.0889113878037814e+63
 When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention	1.5717750921832899e+27
 He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty	1.8676520946995137e+25
 Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever	1.66692210576328e+25
 But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent	2.7195839891139635e+18
  When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs	5368799717.229522
  "You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr	553229288810.3262
 Bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned	1.8314350016973897e+31
 I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement	1.8446702737701317e+28
"  Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business	1.6958068382718037e+23
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year	3.044216318223199e+66
     CHAPTER XII	731.6204861599343
   As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more	6.52289830637933e+31
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her	4982702.280984608
  "Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?"  She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	1.415748196365963e+39
  "He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teazing, teazing, man! I will think no more about him	9.712040097771333e+59
"  Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth	5.816379922900529e+35
  "Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy	3.866652047603504e+19
 I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming	2.8721869229621588e+16
 I am glad he dines here on Tuesday	506009190.87301785
 It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance	1.518146158247679e+20
"  "Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly	78239731569904.61
 "Oh, Jane, take care	77791371.94986309
"  "I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever	2.9147275955856406e+21
  On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two, who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time	1.0681335834032137e+35
 When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister	9.95883307494117e+34
 Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself	2.6780159245539727e+18
 On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided	1.3662232185485243e+25
 He placed himself by her	664816.9646498174
  Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend	459028498045.81537
 He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr	9.856537570475149e+31
 Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm	687323354.2615668
  His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured	4.605809645518954e+47
 Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour	1.879779050866819e+17
 It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour	2.2472393722573685e+19
 Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them	381164465314675.0
 He was on one side of her mother	652622442.0464823
 She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage	1.8289379211316898e+19
 She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did	6.5655379660558575e+35
 Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family	2.961287197186701e+49
  She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance	1.4656214087898609e+44
 Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil	1.602335425862144e+30
 She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend	1.906042260642186e+22
  "If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for ever	3.548236474382497e+25
"  The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair	1.3590999606882425e+66
 And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,  "The men shan't come and part us, I am determined	1.6054398368319115e+36
 We want none of them; do we?"  Darcy had walked away to another part of the room	2.084097185525398e+20
 She followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!  "A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"  She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,  "Is your sister at Pemberley still?"  "Yes, she will remain there till Christmas	inf
 Annesley is with her	78214.21200011391
 The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks	4619202486431.883
"  She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success	2.2130306155865534e+24
 He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away	1.8750865918792983e+31
  When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party	1.622010812740392e+62
 She now lost every expectation of pleasure	50813819.23012391
 They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	7.415607520925914e+40
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them	6.565487263468411e+31
  "Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you	1.2019696358723894e+38
 The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw	430618919114.85864
 The venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch	7.128957405830054e+17
 The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week; and even Mr	1.4784793178901391e+19
 Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least	2.139250711653875e+23
 And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty	453930378083126.5
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not	46567135836948.734
 And what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs	29997341374338.684
 Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last	54906835493.9557
' She did indeed	71751.79305035414
 I do think Mrs	80610.90614773112
"  Mrs	1017.6641180120203
 Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals	1.1290184922201064e+71
 "The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other	369622806911800.4
 I hope we may often meet again	47630712.11361802
"  Elizabeth smiled	8753.01715959871
  "Lizzy, you must not do so	796128624.1664376
 You must not suspect me	688115.8309366758
 I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it	1.1633685820124468e+26
 I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection	1.582560665776453e+21
 It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man	1.0380338189911478e+24
"  "You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment	2.431511188497636e+28
"  "How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"  "And how impossible in others!"  "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"  "That is a question which I hardly know how to answer	2.376719867652989e+51
 We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing	2.590617622410804e+16
 Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your confidante	2.263948430854755e+18
"     CHAPTER XIII	7695.846490956539
   A few days after this visit, Mr	550504770.5384419
 Bingley called again, and alone	6911201.04414674
 His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time	2.2774668172336996e+19
 He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits	318978238772275.3
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	1.506750408966724e+21
  "Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky	3.785999144903324e+18
 &c	728.1875560605945
; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them	2.422407054398217e+18
  "Can you come to-morrow?"  Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity	1.4141161585343708e+25
  He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed	3.727112960704668e+18
 In ran Mrs	8024.103358128077
 Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,  "My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down	9.588786250878634e+30
 He is come--Mr	10228.02257597534
 Bingley is come	8133.623638330936
--He is, indeed	8080104.560202877
 Make haste, make haste	594107.0647875414
 Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair	451889.9333684241
"  "We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago	6.144013951043726e+37
"  "Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! where is your sash my dear?"  But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters	3.0256750301783042e+50
  The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening	3183273387005840.5
 After tea, Mr	81894.50384884587
 Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument	2.8187364147251474e+19
 Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs	39269618208.264534
 Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them	1.4777154628569455e+20
 Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"  "Nothing child, nothing	5.0034404589878574e+45
 I did not wink at you	7060438.229829413
" She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,  "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room	5.005918451106761e+48
 Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it	1.7004509018760087e+28
 In a few minutes, Mrs	7653968.331361025
"  Elizabeth was forced to go	7814636.929385406
 "Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room	4691653779558.359
"  Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room	9.6076852093503e+31
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual	51922956.8086262
 Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter	3159604609415257.5
 His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter	2.422983481915585e+44
  He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs	8.836698880865065e+25
 Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband	32559891996998.105
 Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr	7.61859693730701e+27
 Darcy returned within the stated time	5140880.202318704
 Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence	1.6189455490397968e+19
  Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr	753572714083.1326
 There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him	6.840699909278829e+37
 Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs	442025138543772.6
 Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter	2.7316768410275664e+16
 Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes	3.9343350588141345e+43
  But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her	1.5656685617640255e+35
 On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all	1.4867685309618669e+53
 _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she thought was still worse	1.8154968433586618e+17
 Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room	3.61047971758952e+48
  Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world	6.960293956752255e+34
  "'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much	3357178917766772.0
 Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane	3413208964295.1123
 But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present	2.606103558426717e+24
 "I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself	1.352088713954826e+24
 He is gone to my father already	58357222.94818816
 Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"  She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty	9.36651985577588e+53
  Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation	4.490433891383117e+34
  "And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"  In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose	1.7198558668352982e+58
  "Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door	3.3559526691079076e+16
  "With my mother up stairs	6181944.09346416
 She will be down in a moment I dare say	50602961501.39383
"  He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister	2.9076455907852313e+22
 Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship	27893998520835.805
 They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself	inf
  It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever	3.998534169524915e+35
 Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon	4636612978812.607
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr	6.031101002046467e+36
 Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was	1.6723292946202784e+17
  Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said,  "Jane, I congratulate you	8.021034806638416e+45
 You will be a very happy woman	64083242.127456374
"  Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness	3.527619909394898e+16
  "You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled	2.2282123064245927e+25
 I have not a doubt of your doing very well together	451993618945.7902
 Your tempers are by no means unlike	54011184.07996814
 You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income	6.978376719552882e+36
"  "I hope not so	9057433.707621463
 Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in _me_	243179785809090.94
"  "Exceed their income! My dear Mr	4489129126.406899
 Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more	1.5658280331100648e+28
" Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night	9.987524020854471e+31
 I knew how it would be	7335627.98451496
 I always said it must be so, at last	63081438742.680824
 I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together	4.1022413604667557e+42
 Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"  Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten	2.049261322469331e+21
 Jane was beyond competition her favourite child	41761991.7818624
 Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense	1.6177957488954093e+23
  Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter	1.0801560371917602e+23
  Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur	1.462646711571547e+48
 In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief	1.1536800520241157e+35
  "He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible	7.372615796685891e+38
 "But how did he account for it?"  "It must have been his sister's doing	3.218380054341938e+18
 They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects	1.0037959122883822e+29
 But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other	3.294720630885562e+46
"  "That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever heard you utter	3.761569022444359e+20
 Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard	3.7832977268986106e+21
"  "Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"  "He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty	1.691286735078879e+62
"  This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities	1.1015575432758412e+23
  Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him	8.259209524944312e+43
  "I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried Jane	2390005317569975.0
 "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but such another man for you!"  "If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you	8.600786005642363e+61
 Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness	3530010130877008.5
 No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr	2.8070153875542553e+27
"  The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret	3623151225306046.5
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs	606802260.7062498
 Philips, and _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton	2.8191404397141334e+22
  The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	3.668305478929135e+38
     CHAPTER XIV	743.9554349255245
   One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn	1.0498205118773236e+56
 It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours	3.104499672731817e+25
 The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them	2.1629629122604732e+24
 They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered	8.678562323646892e+29
 It was lady Catherine de Bourgh	5580339.617966327
  They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs	1.6218805413662838e+24
 Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt	3.2181144592992753e+18
  She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word	3.646856855797919e+34
 Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made	1.940641919869078e+22
 Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness	1.4370279328046483e+21
 After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,  "I hope you are well, Miss Bennet	3.630355702155339e+24
 That lady I suppose is your mother	59210506.42953517
  "And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters	5836224491810.014
"  "Yes, madam," said Mrs	8340449633.230766
 Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine	6466113542.661074
 "She is my youngest girl but one	560373127.1144968
 My youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who I believe will soon become a part of the family	7.568816170596583e+34
  "It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's	1.1912889567194465e+28
"  "This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west	2.0058677035943217e+22
 Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added,  "May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr	9.093874539545361e+28
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Collins well	878.0872945738638
"  "Yes, very well	9030320.697709538
"  Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling	1.4576421188913114e+25
 But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled	63764741706.70585
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,  "Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn	1.689346647855866e+59
 I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company	2.7965481526014456e+19
"  "Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the different walks	3.410575925084428e+21
 I think she will be pleased with the hermitage	7324796181.292882
"  Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs	1.4311941481804148e+20
 As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on	8.950092294257028e+34
  Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it	5.628432005427433e+16
 They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable	3.0647789616913413e+35
  "How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face	3.046751881560737e+21
  As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:--  "You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither	6.175475660509841e+36
 Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come	323334504555832.25
  "Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam	729073420.4786882
 I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here	3.6024834462586596e+16
"  "Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with	4.22491146511015e+29
 But however insincere _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so	2.5342658077921833e+19
 My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it	9.65161031827153e+28
 A report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago	25267780819156.34
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
"  "If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far	1.485421988042915e+32
 What could your ladyship propose by it?"  "At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted	1.4141698002447858e+21
"  "If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"  "I never heard that it was	7.3260715735803e+42
"  "And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"  "I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship	9.966804515179168e+30
"  "This is not to be borne	760972763.7082009
 Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied	538279469.6967497
 Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"  "Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	1.8909589406577113e+24
"  "It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason	4.786713999657708e+21
 But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family	2.285886524373118e+29
 You may have drawn him in	6784915.119704267
"  "If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it	5935171908621645.0
"  "Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this	2.7601991769414135e+22
"  "But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit	1.3289039377219121e+26
"  "Let me be rightly understood	52817624.7473672
 This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place	4.668040762401297e+16
 No, never	10214.608177197544
 Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_	573171710.1028154
 Now what have you to say?"  "Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me	1.5464162894013538e+32
"  Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,  "The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind	2.3797204051381933e+22
 From their infancy, they have been intended for each other	491299802090.01965
 While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"  "Yes, and I had heard it before	inf
 But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh	3.440895177823706e+41
 You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage	48907952607619.695
 Its completion depended on others	598606.0680838488
 Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"  "Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it	1.9458609800148137e+49
 Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all	1.3639283029636963e+29
 You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him	3.567995154250467e+16
 Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us	1.6924846991182717e+18
"  "These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth	52352709063.565155
 "But the wife of Mr	8908098.966590328
 Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine	1.3085000225959952e+27
"  "Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score?  "Let us sit down	2.6448843093596134e+38
 You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it	1.7413691839450675e+28
 I have not been used to submit to any person's whims	479106790478.4994
 I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment	65377367507.06264
"  "_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_	1.2057668586682902e+25
"  "I will not be interrupted	77138495.38740973
 Hear me in silence	70368.74614486757
 My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other	34921797619.98308
 They are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families	1.4892669910117958e+31
 Their fortune on both sides is splendid	38067062.10654503
 They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune	6.2838769008020605e+37
 Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be	499726596374204.7
 If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up	2.0174962717948026e+25
"  "In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere	2.6939681548953668e+16
 He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal	2.5045252854953e+16
"  "True	9534.01175372269
 You _are_ a gentleman's daughter	58805278.42989115
 But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition	1.512673040464144e+21
"  "Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_	2.159960094388906e+30
"  "Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"  Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation,  "I am not	4.5625061275788624e+48
"  Lady Catherine seemed pleased	605344.4615364415
  "And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"  "I will make no promise of the kind	2.033559126693288e+25
"  "Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished	5532192306.768373
 I expected to find a more reasonable young woman	4274158924.574566
 But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede	33670717607590.184
 I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable	409329288517.947
 Your ladyship wants Mr	62960.81966896985
 Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make _their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged	1.4066342895320217e+80
 You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these	2.0950544145619357e+20
 How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine	5.8644821201130394e+29
 I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject	567677803503815.9
"  "Not so hasty, if you please	6721663342.155071
 I have by no means done	6558991.550434546
 To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add	3509842761320621.5
 I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement	25301641565938.52
 I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles	2.6064970157934395e+25
 And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is _her_ husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"  "You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered	1.268927918712348e+67
 "You have insulted me, in every possible method	64963437251.91482
 I must beg to return to the house	661457783.3270029
"  And she rose as she spoke	73075992.31468521
 Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back	4163647950.4074087
 Her ladyship was highly incensed	577464.5249035814
  "You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"  "Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say	3.314501431802204e+51
 You know my sentiments	70695.53437550078
"  "You are then resolved to have him?"  "I have said no such thing	4.4471679150508457e+18
 I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me	9.451729601889957e+37
"  "It is well	963073.7707240869
 You refuse, then, to oblige me	718023786.8042145
 You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude	55519858543439.51
 You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world	3.0935928638623225e+22
"  "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance	1.9507035172397273e+27
 No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr	47455163116708.3

 And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn	4.628639747298172e+50
"  "And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well	2.8798105326039165e+17
 I shall now know how to act	55705747.21534033
 Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified	467359840041824.0
 I came to try you	773706.017492515
 I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point	2.203346238616818e+16
"  In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,  "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet	1.0659577691840877e+37
 I send no compliments to your mother	55194144.250760585
 You deserve no such attention	624105.1084980248
 I am most seriously displeased	550211.8987253865
 She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs	290510812227.1036
 Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself	1.3239929333252045e+25
  "She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go	5.924782002547989e+16
"  "She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well	1.2203693030930498e+32
 I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"  Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible	7.763724000262593e+34
   The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly	5.183731469715209e+33
 Lady Catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr	9.111590313731213e+27
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
 It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea	7.879850891490634e+74
 She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together	1.9631778714270634e+19
 And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible, at some future time	1.0223171826894758e+55
  In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference	1.6697525601403726e+26
 From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce	2.0097366005056285e+50
 She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side	5.145399664785348e+76
 With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning	1.2223115832742045e+30
  If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him	3.5960270046000466e+49
 In that case he would return no more	548684075.06605
  "If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand it	1.326639205874881e+35
 I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy	41584194085392.24
 If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all	8.302316413116299e+27
"         *       *       *       *       *  The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs	6.530484632862615e+43
 Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject	29085074085252.05
  The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	1.5708873202773078e+30
  "Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room	4.380364499023407e+20
"  She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held	8.00256208836003e+34
 It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations	2.294834894636491e+21
  She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down	374459399941618.4
 He then said,  "I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly	2.7944601459443728e+17
 I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony	3.0798590723524797e+18
 Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest	38103448268.19657
"  The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,  "You look conscious	1.215962809312169e+62
 This letter is from Mr	715104.2611750996
 Collins	97.7243836727247
"  "From Mr	99144.37323896615
 Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?"  "Something very much to the purpose of course	2.811174876713902e+22
 He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases	1.021225311249711e+30
 I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point	2.3033566702156532e+16
 What relates to yourself, is as follows	557657129.310071
 "Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs	38505506723.558426
 Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority	6.469544562997748e+30
 Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land	7.169165426937338e+49
"  "Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage	4.063986251661479e+44
 Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of	3.911966680865349e+47
"  "Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out	3.0435524842849448e+19
"  "My motive for cautioning you, is as follows	505227359642.79266
 We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye	1.2298886498082706e+24
"  "_Mr	102223.58359003569
 Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you	4.51332846752629e+22
 Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr	9.687813319620966e+34
 Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!"  Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile	1.8329836879610952e+48
 Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her	329083837463919.0
  "Are you not diverted?"  "Oh! yes	486376767505.33057
 Pray read on	7049.271250033132
"  "After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match	8.666052471834291e+63
" "Mr	10876.835996291326
 Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known	1.5994453235178965e+41
 I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married	5.249435307439079e+36
 It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it	2.0323813245761292e+23
" "_That_ is his notion of christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch	1.4810883826602776e+32
 But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it	55264683774791.016
 You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report	3.6011990880715337e+22
 For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"  "Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted	6.634093496099899e+34
 But it is so strange!"  "Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing	3409270624599658.0
 Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr	2.2190886685061832e+44
 Collins's correspondence for any consideration	494668.4622173628
 Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law	1.010562042935454e+32
 And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"  To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it	1.736061259712744e+51
 Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not	2.7835665183375504e+17
 Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr	399444630125005.3
 Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_	7.195135995890205e+38
     CHAPTER XVI	749.1078607080937
   Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr	2.410404191261553e+17
 Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit	1.4261642417012679e+23
 The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs	5627598173.469921
 Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out	6.20934243611255e+36
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together	1.6021731133758779e+22
 Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them	62747309181078.89
 They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other	3.7554789073289696e+17
 Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same	5.0234513060395676e+32
  They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone	3.613786976852297e+38
 Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said,  "Mr	4.249673447986164e+25
 Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's	9.635584958778845e+30
 Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it	2.197066016842983e+21
 Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express	2.7361491327176632e+20
 I did not think Mrs	783994.4103618766
 Gardiner was so little to be trusted	62463973.6525157
"  "You must not blame my aunt	646053095.768028
 Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars	1.359193186874663e+29
 Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them	7.997241998623568e+40
"  "If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone	3.568796732498078e+21
 That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny	1.7660075519384603e+27
 But your _family_ owe me nothing	461701197.13226074
 Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of _you_	5.366964728553302e+16
"  Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word	51595677825.39393
 After a short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me	2.6732461970087767e+18
 If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once	2.8245421125432796e+16
 _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever	1.6576533004010427e+22
"  Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances	1.0828945338887411e+64
 The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	3.327748269721455e+39
 Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable	2.646464621326117e+66
  They walked on, without knowing in what direction	4679722849.074302
 There was too much to be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects	3.8823353788442496e+20
 She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give	inf
 But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise	41523683128894.7
 I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly	1.8232814433494137e+34
"  Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_	1.7678398586118536e+28
 After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations	1.6880972338768414e+21
 It was unpardonable	8327.421671191587
 I cannot think of it without abhorrence	58267263.96563953
"  "We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said Elizabeth	3.4043091953287325e+20
 "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility	2.6529600657787633e+28
 The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me	1.6461368635497712e+36
 Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner	1.3511536403566234e+21
' Those were your words	538775.9584487703
 You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice	1.6522374881943163e+31
"  "I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression	2.5166794876270864e+16
 I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way	3444279860706325.0
 You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did	3786268045468953.0
 The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me	1.185588032538239e+32
"  "Oh! do not repeat what I then said	457898697098.034
 These recollections will not do at all	52428860.79181666
 I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it	433631412113619.4
"  Darcy mentioned his letter	727059.2515243334
 "Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"  She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed	2.444088292361988e+55
  "I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary	4.373813165708579e+22
 I hope you have destroyed the letter	63047239.91971251
 There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again	2.141969641085016e+22
 I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me	2296158394554.6445
"  "The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies	6.806942563408671e+49
"  "When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit	7.581075952455517e+35
 The adieu is charity itself	696369.3342693355
 But think no more of the letter	71603757.59594145
 The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten	6.508952438777118e+36
 You must learn some of my philosophy	52066342.0359978
 Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure	334293770216.6281
"  "I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind	42763827712686.336
 But with _me_, it is not so	75485356151.36139
 Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled	383671273202133.1
 I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle	3.2059971868764166e+17
 As a child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper	2.1493248137876414e+21
 I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit	3880919351276418.5
 Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_) I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own	inf
 Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous	3.838966438413673e+47
 I came to you without a doubt of my reception	53021362436.21606
 You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	1.449725491976813e+17
"  "Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"  "Indeed I had	4.731747862503699e+16
 What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses	2.5373954837385533e+18
"  "My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you	3.560967870892017e+16
 I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong	2375940701669092.0
 How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"  "Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction	5.042617187402774e+33
"  "I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley	2.2910299708229104e+19
 You blamed me for coming?"  "No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise	3.6494054597758104e+16
"  "Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you	2.5168382027890166e+17
 My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due	8.593327782026549e+26
"  "My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to	1.903123994620393e+61
 How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you	8.965493530437906e+24
"  He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend	1.55491812713337e+76
  She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther	2.371236755150545e+21
  After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home	1.2867202785176553e+37
  "What could become of Mr	7361541.137356258
 Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs	2.7904875717310726e+17
 Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it	2.4713605548190864e+17
  "I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth	4381678203762.245
  "Not at all	94926.33915491661
 When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen	4579721611354.912
"  "That is to say, you had given your permission	6433990323159.038
 I guessed as much	75531.54882200346
" And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case	4.013496423209324e+19
  "On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago	1.7708718369466833e+31
 I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent	2.005365993294668e+20
 His surprise was great	77221.77480645527
 He had never had the slightest suspicion	55687910.248118244
 I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together	5.821364543778126e+48
"  Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend	273796110127856.9
  "Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"  "From the former	6.985086177276995e+36
 I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection	1.4990071223424424e+24
"  "And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him	4.717033374775715e+16
"  "It did	103650.09290666971
 Bingley is most unaffectedly modest	654643.862269357
 His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy	7.856153558055625e+25
 I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him	3.8205740369376444e+19
 I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him	8.872817045998088e+30
 He was angry	8454.314774128683
 But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments	1.529339843330089e+21
"  Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr	65972100.42296139
 Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself	1.1709994518820406e+21
 She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin	3.1164208583084737e+21
 In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house	1.7504996142803502e+28
 In the hall they parted	677824.5411534974
     CHAPTER XVII	754.9460276189992
   "My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table	6.412541845226449e+40
 She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge	2.541728685817244e+21
 She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth	1.9630179152212153e+21
  The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary	44863487587.179306
 The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent	452960591981.4581
 Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her	3.9767315328258506e+50
 She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	1.9363307795391376e+48
  At night she opened her heart to Jane	538853241.2777823
 Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here	1.5794474037517212e+16
  "You are joking, Lizzy	9912724.949934714
 This cannot be!--engaged to Mr	874991.7944166989
 Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me	592800596813.033
 I know it to be impossible	8023216.401718708
"  "This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not	8.491203139038268e+29
 Yet, indeed, I am in earnest	732973601.2860664
 He still loves me, and we are engaged	4986356912.61623
"  Jane looked at her doubtingly	8271228.459440926
 "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be	678562220.156864
 I know how much you dislike him	59484130.158917814
"  "You know nothing of the matter	785412118.0658367
 _That_ is all to be forgot	668832587.3466961
 Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now	37117237485174.82
 But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable	3566019145983.2104
 This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself	412193143436.13385
"  Miss Bennet still looked all amazement	50622472.78183593
 Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth	471765581363.1998
  "Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried Jane	2.2652237639525823e+20
 "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"  "There can be no doubt of that	7.90747491322759e+38
 But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"  "Very, very much	3.2856130394848705e+22
 Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight	3426905748.999185
 But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible	513587431170.98663
 And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection	1.0597529266620203e+22
 Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"  "Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all	8.198480064811062e+38
"  "What do you mean?"  "Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley	2.8714701675510867e+24
 I am afraid you will be angry	57159505.97174084
"  "My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious	4967533659130.966
 Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay	36687801498358.94
 Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"  "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began	1.111164992870617e+28
 But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley	1.8783798665745776e+16
"  Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment	1.0050716103937261e+27
 When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish	34790646242230.53
  "Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself	4.320080742596543e+20
 I always had a value for him	64193442.88410923
 Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me	9.46896346747832e+37
 But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me	42554493817649.84
 How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you	2.0108539471114578e+29
"  Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy	5959362659.327907
 She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend	1.2392553294048699e+26
 But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage	2948281006953366.0
 All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation	490136290640.1713
         *       *       *       *       *  "Good gracious!" cried Mrs	2483940915965.04
 Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr	3.8197733384417075e+17
 Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company	2.025444790416358e+48
 What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way	1.8508819793558099e+25
"  Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet	6.615362365177726e+26
  As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr	8.326277455257042e+37
 Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning	65353067653.025505
 Darcy has never seen the view	5767478.960332746
"  "It may do very well for the others," replied Mr	579437738602582.4
 Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty	396989628659900.75
 Wont it, Kitty?"  Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home	3336216530900469.5
 Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented	2.0650647342445837e+17
 As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs	46687437771.26713
 Bennet followed her, saying,  "I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself	2.2274908468647902e+27
 But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then	9.654461185104403e+33
 So, do not put yourself to inconvenience	577112325.9787403
"  During their walk, it was resolved that Mr	57892375740.552826
 Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening	413362377709.22626
 Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's	4901060754.320729
 She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	6.555161877929403e+28
 But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr	3.1422380169561723e+41
 Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation	3.458087360692514e+17
         *       *       *       *       *  In the evening, soon after Mr	3481820666672.401
 Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr	6340309451.086871
 Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme	2774864101683724.5
 She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr	1.8576568820478894e+67
 Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile	3.4456853861216727e+18
 In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library	7.07682579274851e+40
" She was gone directly	762965.2829196679
  Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious	3860560518359.1885
 "Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"  How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr	inf
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
 But will they make you happy?"  "Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?"  "None at all	1.4657057089820815e+32
 We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him	1.6211568924705896e+24
"  "I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him	5.309942914888663e+24
 Indeed he has no improper pride	4919075.340598888
 You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms	1.6058958001334307e+22
"  "Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent	5.6513847916251064e+16
 He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask	2.173436770691843e+24
 I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him	4.34011086489233e+16
 But let me advise you to think better of it	50599690510.56622
 I know your disposition, Lizzy	6933214.106899234
 I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior	7.992699041567863e+26
 Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage	201584249891712.22
 You could scarcely escape discredit and misery	43540641.93757123
 My child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life	1.7302044350332016e+21
"  Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr	2.1364993339084888e+24
 Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match	7.328477155129133e+67
  "Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say	4.8408484870566514e+22
 If this be the case, he deserves you	6301357426.386742
 I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy	3.930934520411085e+16
"  To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr	40386476931631.01
 He heard her with astonishment	713913.2017216289
 It will save me a world of trouble and economy	39862217496.131805
 Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way	6.392730098450006e+27
 I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter	1.4740523802743648e+28
"  He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr	2889143548302731.5
 Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure	4.373590085678203e+44
 Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time	4.941777829598457e+36
  When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication	2.4142613370594915e+20
 Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs	33019653667831.145
 Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable	379375772766.10034
 Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them	8.506978866573407e+45
 She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself	1.8846158225136316e+26
  "Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr	1848102573325870.8
 Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all	2.7225763379346624e+47
 I am so pleased--so happy	813357.5066871205
 Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before	1.1733101602744664e+23
 A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me	4.795563536148551e+28
 I shall go distracted	64831.50783707458
"  This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away	7.321785714282192e+30
 But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her	3.33325556974547e+16
  "My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence	3.9139521111246605e+38
 You must and shall be married by a special licence	40265768513.54111
 But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr	38501613423.41249
 Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow	4792808199192.591
"  This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for	4.0598313123096335e+48
 But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs	28633556220634.332
 Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion	4.653166289715862e+38
  Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr	2.5570202727412664e+18
 Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem	32698447359243.04
  "I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he	5544548908072.723
"     CHAPTER XVIII	7646.664244928084
   Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr	326962758837.8527
 Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her	3993359299886.412
 "How could you begin?" said she	6126994082.107232
 It is too long ago	647720.6644898824
 I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun	427312999776384.7
"  "My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not	7.010519747697152e+42
 Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"  "For the liveliness of your mind, I did	2.5187738232652803e+23
"  "You may as well call it impertinence at once	450139410861.408
 It was very little less	733050.7160981691
 The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention	3.972550852585888e+17
 You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone	1.5522590789772195e+21
 I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_	4428524359352769.0
 Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you	2.4965801565265847e+48
 There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable	1.7128864618271248e+25
 To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love	1.9730800880799665e+22

 My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last	1.2162218480967202e+62

 I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect	8.156358857584808e+30
 _Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject? This will never do	6.068362518756222e+39

 Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts	2.1216841695967464e+16
 I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude	1.81612218616804e+16
 I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's	41107221739768.25

"  "Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use	2.261700370684389e+24
 But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?"  "My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me	1.2552211817149887e+62
 My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made	9.071515895193811e+38

"  From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr	3569439083710.288
 Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs	535615795281.6011
 Gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:       "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have      done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but      to say the truth, I was too cross to write	inf

 You must write again very      soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last	2.139970903752826e+20
 I      thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes	578882124777477.0

       Your's, &c	64529.22457873462
"  Mr	1062.5139163277404
 Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr	2.4373809378537395e+21
 Bennet sent to Mr	81681.65545159922
 Collins, in reply to his last	79905003.3683669
       "DEAR SIR,       "I must trouble you once more for congratulations	41052387178352.46
 Elizabeth will      soon be the wife of Mr	687452600.98544
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
 Console Lady Catherine as well as      you can	478957239.4963444
 But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew	61739963461650.72
 He has      more to give	770804.962037169
       "Your's sincerely, &c	5266534.883185773
"  Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere	2.510685672662587e+20
 She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard	2.081033931359219e+22
 Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved	9.70276422755226e+31
 Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	1.0859467104145577e+23
  Before any answer could arrive from Mr	46698111.699863404
 Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge	1.6229620170118373e+25
 The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident	4132088289.4417467
 Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over	4.653769207452797e+35
 At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr	8.569502652049411e+36
 Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband	6096703037272.594
 He bore it however with admirable calmness	43088629.35548914
 He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St	4.3961168543908544e+33
 James's, with very decent composure	5614300.472340755
 If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight	4.21307769559105e+17
  Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs	2.7544149120767744e+17
 Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar	5.3679041481166394e+38
 Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant	2.177772402209555e+22
 Elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley	inf
     CHAPTER XIX	979.1316786136158
   Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs	3820824570416.066
 Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters	3377844272.070738
 With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs	392917417.7496053
 Bingley and talked of Mrs	797004.663579833
 Darcy may be guessed	67758.47298224339
 I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly	inf
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do	7.892320479451265e+21
 He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected	35636039193517.15
  Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth	4221198527.662333
 So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart	1.3385759524976013e+27
 The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other	5.1355366511527475e+41
  Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters	2.582741202052281e+19
 In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great	3168087390848048.0
 She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid	1.389489827809427e+39
 From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs	2.3539597970127712e+17
 Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going	1.5095202187609814e+28
  Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs	1.3137051914620218e+22
 Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone	38141429.03662656
 Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance	3.365846968851568e+52
 He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune	1.8564856479837652e+48
 The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished	1.529368287016036e+33
 The letter was to this effect:       "MY DEAR LIZZY,       "I wish you joy	3.504165816462722e+17
 If you love Mr	80670.11707881211
 Darcy half as well as I do my dear      Wickham, you must be very happy	3.551442354095289e+16
 It is a great comfort to have you      so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will      think of us	2.620490074045665e+27
 I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very      much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live      upon without some help	5.767773142656495e+29
 Any place would do, of about three or four      hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr	2.0467412181975614e+23
       "Yours, &c	662908.9739843328
"  As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	1.3606672542164293e+30
 Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them	8.928721167764193e+32
 It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills	4.956861071828261e+64
 Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme	1.7970592761477023e+22
 They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought	1.551192161224695e+22
  Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession	1.3626577554574138e+24
 Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone	7.98293645866057e+57
  Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see	2.010624650393952e+20
 They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended	333219214705103.8
 Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother	7.103541835541246e+35
 He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry	1.2400379713599155e+24
 By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	4.1237176643969347e+33
  Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end	1.2255887332332325e+58
 But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	inf
  With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms	4070708111846.379
 Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them	6.962202524447053e+38
