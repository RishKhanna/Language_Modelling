  However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters1.7622531115624897e+79

"  "But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs4.338036260221507e+25
"  "I do not believe Mrs39879.061820553274

 Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you1.2595952519874422e+18
"  "Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs105138842749.33817

 But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs1.2065540137909303e+23
 "Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_8.256034777677065e+42
 Bingley32.63584333211581
"  The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs6.351235313277015e+20
  "How good it was in you, my dear Mr2266511947750.74
 Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last112146809016224.22
 I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance7.537874418866343e+19
"  "Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr2.684413625653368e+17
 He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party2.558776949621566e+38
  "If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs3.1507044109076427e+19
 Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library1565282415271081.8
 He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father5.128942584237838e+37
  An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs5.460583137835738e+17
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr3.4091187820628025e+44
 Darcy danced only once with Mrs1708987801.9252226
  Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr4.27269851666676e+36
  "Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very agreeable1.5636847789558113e+47
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party1.3553764235124691e+17
 Jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way2.1063588164187787e+24
  "Oh! my dear Mr306.6841257372756
 Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"  "If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners9.491470457863639e+105
 So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs5.940295751604102e+65
 What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room5.2998730623275386e+39
  His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs1.8130306029238434e+50
 Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House7.718367381183091e+32
 He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting4.571856469882197e+31
 In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage22823424493799.77
 Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty6.653798794753961e+52
 By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St3895218231642223.5
 The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend9.595625551140373e+29
 To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something about Mr4.249690608274408e+42
 Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point3.548891803027278e+86
 But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs5.8195088307173554e+35
"  "His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it3.786360725128277e+35
 I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day4.538930256862262e+29
"  "Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs1.1140741344270026e+16
"  The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit3.1798592120501136e+33
 Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs1.3048539480275864e+19
 If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark3.4316839071763144e+59
 Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal5.52470004058134e+60
 Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend1.1290094057908161e+32
"  "It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas1.1397798332841453e+18
 Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I shall keep mine to swell my song4.602130226428147e+56
 Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room5.102018721323954e+102
  Mr7.688630579355423
--Every savage can dance108179661145.20047
 James's?"  "Never, sir80381473433.55267
"  He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,  "My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr3.5242392125463902e+72
  "He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?"  Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away1.5749935954394016e+48
 "I am all astonishment2332244.6116213966
 I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced980922919560201.5
"  Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London3.908071642221425e+49
"  Mrs21.43911708981833
 "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_84053205102906.36
"  "Dining out," said Mrs442205726.4188331
"  "I had much rather go in the coach2909554874732.1313
 They are wanted in the farm, Mr293425.4031944314
 Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted2.2064458802084772e+16
 Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:       "My dearest Lizzy,       "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be      imputed to my getting wet through yesterday2.306179968684452e+67
 She will be taken good care of213291456584.27942
 She declared her resolution150934623.15214238
  She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise6.262171093601194e+33
 Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance4.213810840207287e+66
 Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present1.0016313664397423e+62
 Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes1.4446498540429353e+45
 The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike7.547421385846988e+101
  Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency1.8951184908086466e+25
 She really looked almost wild79601010199.09816
 I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning3.2543987110300805e+20
  "I am afraid, Mr188906.7294604854
  "If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable2.556822329812265e+35
  With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee1.6646240268426182e+38
 On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book2.75767250266527e+82
 Mr7.688630579355423
  "I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books5.819421688180263e+22
 Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite1.7662197709916453e+36
 I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished5.899523005712996e+44
 A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved7.077199140177079e+94
"  "I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women8.264311759385246e+21
 Bingley urged Mr2425011.733842782
 Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable4.738178621254635e+19
 They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister4.783377534587873e+65
 Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters1.2406498724124347e+29
  "Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer461126855.97941136
 Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments26199129910.943626
 At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here7391747167269777.0
  "You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her1.5577146175816855e+18
  "Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly1973044578070.737
"  "I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character3.640010952088609e+20
 They have at least that advantage1326301278.2355614
"  "The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study1.4223257915485048e+27
 The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr1.180684182976346e+16
 They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either4.813269222942976e+21
"  "Aye--that is because you have the right disposition6531250001233461.0
 But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all1.0603040401791959e+23
 Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every body1.5934515643299576e+39
 I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body better looking1.2973165766887449e+32
 When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away3.972728022533854e+47
 Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield3.767667386971769e+21
"  Mrs21.43911708981833
 Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr4.29680249128213e+39
 The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each3.312492472904651e+80
  "How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"  He made no answer3.540917333381338e+21
"  "I am afraid you do not like your pen19034015836.52287
  "Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's6.881377587326612e+65
"  "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At present I have not room to do them justice1.3040959769695217e+36
"  "Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable6.05503101261496e+22
"  "Your humility, Mr18491622.902380113
 At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies4.140423380653067e+31
"  "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either1.1097730067430083e+19
 Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection3.824662475221663e+17
"  "Perhaps I do50593.86114753471
 If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me3.3602638230852805e+37
  When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music2.867842469427602e+24
 Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her--  "Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"  She smiled, but made no answer6.428464529873198e+50
"  Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her2.5815920597605878e+72
"  "Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"  "Oh! yes2.804602212447465e+18
--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley6.908907365443224e+23
  "I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard1.3399228656127345e+26
 Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening6.0813927109378334e+26
   When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared2.0658442947633315e+82
 They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit2.650726501433304e+37
 He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else3339216456743535.0
 Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight3.109851907563228e+22
  When tea was over, Mr200596.1394528586
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep2.4095737033063113e+31
 Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page9.078500177016984e+45
 It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day3.06519881800502e+28
"  Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room397666422410153.7
 In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said,  "Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room8.126121635050617e+53
 Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives2.833690047280954e+24
 How shall we punish him for such a speech?"  "Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth5.756458405240486e+32
 "That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance6.970173797396699e+33
 I dearly love a laugh83149692327.56284
 Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can3.3670929271525838e+38
"  "Perhaps that is not possible for any one1613564471772.7139
"  "Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed4450668930406.275
 But pride--where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation1.6497948337181217e+29

 Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before2.145312682219346e+51

--But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle8.634430901406029e+35
 Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married1.0446462581962045e+72

 Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen5.3841751538222146e+39
     CHAPTER XIV52.675062424389665
 Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness1.7326126157765858e+66
 Bennet could not have chosen better46668256.38086004
 Mr7.688630579355423
 She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her2.255407915821725e+30
 Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman7185712276.602485
"  "Ah!" cried Mrs21350.72764522712
--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay1.2630001293272153e+43
"  Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr1.1738304042552463e+19
 It amazes me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction3.940331898132119e+31
"  Then turning to Mr7038722.04674987
 Mrs9.62941339842944
--Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice6.297292311555313e+53
--"As to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged5.145107967841405e+78
  Mrs9.62941339842944
  Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr2.542307521099426e+31
 Bennet exceedingly65966.5738419011
 Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr1.5609471557858164e+23

  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Collins by Jane's introduction of him15461950950.680386
 She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice4.203497736731636e+72
 Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr2.506099974689424e+64
 Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows3.9479249767161116e+65
 He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before1.7476281311713545e+64
     CHAPTER XVI52.675062424389665
 Collins's scruples of leaving Mr2638392858.87284
  When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr5.973890995207948e+20
 The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr1.6376864445373864e+33
  Mr7.688630579355423
"  Elizabeth could not but look surprised248597720.90802366
--Here you are in your own family1012628544534.3805
"  "I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen5.531743074142708e+45
 A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible4.3318921358654105e+30
 Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it2.153889329003041e+78
"  "This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced2.096094831824678e+16
  "But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"  "A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy1.1455867146286406e+71
 Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it5.844268830888998e+41
 It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor5.164764164887441e+46
 She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished3.1729243666144725e+24
 Bingley! How can Mr33389976.779481
"  This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley1.0098621457766864e+20
  "Mr15.772602668744852
 Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully2.3454924594144338e+23
 Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr4.8549840564655e+32
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
     CHAPTER XVII79.28044708716925
   Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr1219264814394.594
 Wickham and herself1259.373469244514
 My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr1.0785311555553675e+19
 Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony1.4920114159094198e+39
 Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public5.769346688421596e+27
 Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday8.035719727590472e+34
 Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr5.303135615600111e+44
 The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her1.0887436548976619e+32
 Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her23407349542620.117
 Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give3.229860800949839e+63
  She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked5.818156852461173e+32
 He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her2.6478510642530645e+34
 Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it1.6681988135102434e+26
--But _now_ we may be silent5605861487.451295
 It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible3.4696345666921574e+54
"  "I must not decide on my own performance2831925144807.802
 Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, Sir1775522241754067.2
 Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves4.96421494250506e+27
 Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable1.6918765145192694e+24
 Darcy's steward6213.701046221356
 Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening9.661096117489003e+41
 Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr2.98249194448396e+24
 I am perfectly satisfied2069.4908377387446
 I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier1.0742654846200842e+17
"--It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man1.804323944191744e+20
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr5.619970565705e+16
 Mr7.688630579355423
 When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr6.897404236717637e+94
--What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr4.267968885038595e+16
 Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her8.842380103640558e+41
 Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another2.601846905716539e+101
 Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman3.228466573198727e+61
 I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family1.8199566080635283e+47
 Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable1.5579526955728192e+54
 She was teazed by Mr6834741.323855194
 There was no arguing upon such a project3103737950588.763
 She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr1.2011407870505301e+28
  The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs9.580218159755536e+26
 Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves1.4643452630989652e+33
 Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests5.708769821575681e+33
 Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr1.5282997777468598e+46
 Mr7.688630579355423
--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection1.7162804138852605e+18
--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs161259846798566.8
 Collins must excuse me5760606.732983286
 You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address8.710576186826917e+50
 Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr2.7326217676642586e+20
 To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents1.6338904236594974e+59
 I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time5.878445976256338e+45
 You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say5.73577713070805e+20
 I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere3.209147217401735e+17
 I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible1.3314003377983465e+29
 Bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so1.4662242401637678e+48
 She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it7.789519681294803e+31
"  "Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr5088576737356.663
"  "Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs164791093307160.8
 In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived7.435379645020061e+17
 Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_1.4246524481074963e+30
 She shall hear my opinion388513190.88988656
"  "An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth391892936358528.6
 Though her manner varied however, her determination never did7.347529559538558e+18
 "Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves2.9502814511343186e+55
 People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking1.0453952314292498e+30
"  Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation1.2198837955510216e+40
 Collins and me have a little conversation together275805970901.24896
"  Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr1.2599303923122912e+50
 In a doleful voice Mrs761902115.70962
 You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr3.996540425945836e+51
 My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own1.4001705254078854e+37
 Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother1.1311720368382283e+45
  The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs2336904981691.1973
 When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,  "This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal2.9895021880048016e+46
  "It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country2.2506001325903175e+28
"  "Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter1.3541940990165593e+24
 Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I despair9.271559718103983e+48
 I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable3.1114017621934543e+44
 My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart9.107372739974221e+87
 With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"  "What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"--said Jane as she finished it7.374479073818064e+76
 "Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"  "Yes, there can; for mine is totally different1.3382405365916053e+122
 Could she have seen half as much love in Mr49421752946917.89
 But the case is this24588939.4074786
 We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way1.4277689168122553e+97
--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine1.438944406051266e+24
" Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time8.809189704022834e+36
  In as short a time as Mr469072135213.6677
 Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair3.3121511730994025e+46
 The least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person5.075920311135196e+40
  As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs6.570932053425668e+43
"  "Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire1.4759972509388787e+65
 She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion2.2952337855432454e+81
 Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"  But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness3.928160030383969e+86
 Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted7.812527917975201e+28
 Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day1.6198432126666211e+72
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs3.2449926392103748e+32
 Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted6.514048100423672e+42
 Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr2.7562772014784943e+28
 Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"  "I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr5.532906033203916e+30
 I1535.8292037052333
 Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it4277827223611.79
  Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation8.002011717721573e+25
 That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations1.6344438435765715e+104
 Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself1.2889146200763646e+59
 Thank God! I have not _that_ pain1702510186715857.0
 A little time therefore53546729.522627115
"  "My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good4332604743670499.5
 They will ruin your happiness335357184.3637803
 Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin4.172593865589306e+66
"  "To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart9.499911859370564e+71
 Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking1.8392055349505094e+60
 But enough of this5207298.995998006
 I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk2.3082517009708692e+48
"  "And do you impute it to either of those?"  "Yes; to the last1.5560913479835795e+20
 Stop me whilst you can16487607117947.635
"  "Yes, in conjunction with his friend1077623689.1898217
 Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it5.3865269235890306e+38
"  "Your first position is false209747868695.94064
 Do not distress me by the idea6640126784.499603
 I am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters1.0284426007339161e+40
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 I congratulate her960238.3243988354
 It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions8.507660192341855e+23
 Darcy was condemned as the worst of men3834356150472.7354
 Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday2348245500900503.5
 Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education1.466426031666063e+31
 The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable1.6123980482103025e+44
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions2.7043341649897857e+31
 Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of2.4863726946291835e+18
 Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it7.559652738376592e+21
  "I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr1.6604811273898942e+16
 He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him1.1712575965248848e+21
 The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever1.6762157572598434e+35
 The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister104431723095494.23
 They are all for what they can get1489205592851.263
 "I am sorry it went off1678803.966102351
 But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr3.119314826564448e+22
 He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her1.1915928189956205e+19
 But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything5.480162993669497e+51
 We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her9.88458090564969e+67
 Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr6.884966719395019e+34
 Bingley never stirs without him17329781617.13352
 I hope they will not meet at all11518358880.788181
  Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him1.60270039331977e+72
 When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr2.0142087488653906e+30
 They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring3.2947406771248024e+67
     CHAPTER III52.66659867208486
 Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:  "You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly2.1189647484406923e+90
 Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent6.4214014747085934e+32
 At present I am not in love with Mr119400498.16530383
--Oh! _that_ abominable Mr30432690698.60401
 Will you come and see me?"  "We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire1.1588238767726472e+22
 Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford113245771106.56927
  "My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party7.696707645053234e+29
 Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them4.054143505923552e+17
  Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is1.2890181161803457e+25
 I enquired after their brother, of course416571081938.2428
 I wish I could see her97497.03404171547
"  Elizabeth shook her head over this letter174326354740.25446
 The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt2.903965941030248e+21
 I do not at      all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but      if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should      be deceived again8.437587599733624e+44
 I need not explain myself farther; and      though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she      feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so      deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may      feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable3.277144146390899e+89
 I cannot but wonder,      however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at      all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago6.183071954823705e+46
 Let me hear      from you very soon166232173.95341557
 I am      sure you will be very comfortable there3299179035.899987
"  This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least8.324836043173737e+38
 Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain2.2412697019423863e+29
 My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance4.431148096931911e+53
   With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away6.963800219538478e+58
 There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake3.057557379111131e+52
 The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay3.2090146266342134e+36
  Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt14240483301642.006
"  "No--why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"  "But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event5.112152326925912e+91
 Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him2.8462686563347213e+41
 Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes24118390.564648215
 Adieu to disappointment and spleen71478143842.0867
 Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party2.3344570814340167e+44
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground5.796117028173754e+18
  From his garden, Mr4831999.18475775
 It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr2.8503679160684068e+16
 I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several5.7841527464863715e+20
"  Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate3.1945834109785746e+64
  "And is this all?" cried Elizabeth422293706.703519
 The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough6.919264318968758e+84
 But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"  "I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire4.426860382622272e+114
--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr2.5291960142170696e+39
  When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm2.5664123514941737e+35
 Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater8.955350976889757e+52
--It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family3056747234240458.0
"  "Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you4.4878363173035834e+17
 The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's5.151974420624326e+27
"  "What, none of you?"  "Not one11732714342688.033
"  "My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London1.065208056501075e+19
"  Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case3438935091259002.0
 It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way6.356765480588787e+22
 I am always glad to get a young person well placed out5.713827608858877e+19
 Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her1.9058800609598725e+55
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure9.70512697797794e+35
' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"  "Yes, Ma'am, all6.286390324309751e+20
 And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind9.75308010978057e+35
 Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr9526173.639014263
 Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light8.282907185735834e+39
 He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names1.901585235366474e+19
 Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered2508803996796.4976
  From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr1.51076229984665e+22
  Very few days passed in which Mr1601906842.2413564
 Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important1.1214728802653905e+46
 There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr1.9654977087798956e+19
"  Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room6.23841104569765e+46
 Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure8.667075246307684e+23
 Darcy they had only seen at church1225162476724.4849
"  "We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply3.187025689927232e+19
 And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply1.0590983350579782e+21
  "I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal1.1521218829205286e+43
"  "So much the better100.8495988474052
 Jenkinson's room20949767.372174297
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer4.257797412385619e+19
 Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,  "You mean to frighten me, Mr1.560372136505131e+41
"  "I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own2.6214887677597036e+68
  "Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam1.4423912869832729e+20
"  "You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful3.7498441779695324e+18
 But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practising6.244357114094057e+25
     CHAPTER IX79.28044708716925
 As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr3.0765915624802776e+67
 Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr329067313471.86115
 Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle7.070924341951345e+41
 Collins first came to Hunsford8301604.282170062
 Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance1490130297129832.0
 "I should never have said Mrs366843.858056837
 Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far3.121932377626449e+22
 But that is not the case _here_158974104228.34225
 Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day6.835369334921068e+87
  She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs1.2273644692105873e+31
  In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam1.7325138543012195e+23
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
"  "I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage1.6619836814292272e+41
 Are you going much farther?"  "No, I should have turned in a moment6.3898039530448855e+19
 But I am at his disposal715496.8603121637
 Darcy18.017419673323744
 It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor6.727959491084998e+33
 I speak feelingly1295965.208751794
 But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money1.3717050505182695e+21
"  He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped9.432382286585668e+18
 I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind2.0025564740422736e+22
 She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs77939431171358.25
 Hurst and Miss Bingley295.45904126242874
 I think I have heard you say that you know them1274454730.0925722
 Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him9383806653751212.0
"  "Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care2.120660113888365e+39
 Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"  "I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady2.48890855851053e+24
 After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful2.8571134391068112e+20
 It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case2713659548256.877
 There could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr3.7118777957213427e+22
 Darcy could have such boundless influence39139445491.29355
  "To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection5.4253260853681565e+23
 He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security6.011534294436667e+27
 I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one5535310093946.129
 The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation1.6310663586393e+42
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful7779488029266.942
 He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity6.642989425480564e+17
 You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert7.220518296780565e+34
 I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been1.483820385862546e+27
"  And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house1.813427126745525e+36
 But the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name2.077693680111419e+33
--The envelope itself was likewise full271208155221663.2
      You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I      demand it of your justice5.09154978362795e+54
 Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in      defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,      ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr3.14641284841997e+52
--I had often seen him in love before33103035657.946247
 He spoke of it as a certain event,      of which the time alone could be undecided1.3097771431820345e+25
--The situation of your mother's      family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that      total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed      by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by      your father1.8436219452315107e+63
--But, however this remonstrance might have      staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it      would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been      seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your      sister's indifference3.7205200369990494e+71
 He had before believed her to return his      affection with sincere, if not with equal regard1.0916200538582258e+25
 To persuade him against      returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,      was scarcely the work of a moment1.0609036089605107e+31
 Wickham, I can only      refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my      family3.5003749327317605e+25
 Darcy could not have201144.2173242488
 There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds568910856.2732459
 His own      father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these      events, Mr8.339769679389531e+28
 Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally      resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it      unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary      advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be      benefited1.2721248178216273e+71
 In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his      studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all      restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation2.763443642275284e+55
 Having said thus much, I feel no      doubt of your secrecy3.095151505720998e+19
 She was then but      fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her      imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to      herself8.27685641921672e+45
 Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my      sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot      help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a      strong inducement3.1199173319863405e+49
 But I was not then      master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed1.1791999448293506e+25
 She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes1.1449465581501938e+53
 It was all pride and insolence2233013617.083443
 On both sides it was only assertion286282083509.0247
 After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read1.322390279975975e+25
 His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn3.3057267179653496e+60
 Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr334601737.0869555
  When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe1.0797513453468193e+43
  The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt694512859469326.1
  Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party30792788957133.938
 His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases224903545522.71753
 I expected you to stay two months634461090.082144
 Collins so before you came110076180.89126623

--Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father1.26567398478089e+18
 You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves9.87302762088648e+27
 It is highly improper80123993.26540646
 You must contrive to send somebody31539108802.75832
 Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner7.4553023984391e+22
 Where shall you change horses?--Oh! Bromley, of course6.646940188930477e+18
 Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections3.649420866345796e+73
 They were hopeless of remedy7786716003.247483
 Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil3.1778991984962486e+64
 While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever2.8077850882078852e+41
 How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!  When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful9.200480676170089e+128
  Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first6.119235481454828e+23
   On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr850490665.3189671
 She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged4.515895553185075e+40
 Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent6.43932917309487e+48
 My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking6.190746641294497e+18
 There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us1.2598945829361654e+22
 We seem to have been designed for each other883905038.711121
 Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr6.184792993118468e+52
 But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation7.7369735504716455e+25
  It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr1.04190460466685e+32
"  "Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction55055584787883.03
  "They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all5.299206532866341e+58
 Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"  "Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once1.0613953623367555e+61
"  "Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to table130255973758820.12
 "What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like1.6346592513288538e+32
"  Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay5.7844235854559406e+20
 But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone2.9409428707934906e+17
 There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay2.484355192476687e+28
"  "She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him1.4245052220504198e+16
  "I am sure there is not on _his_48462524636.18264
 I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her2.182720556975532e+21
 She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think4.417889582479961e+52
 In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account3.950655671230091e+32
 Darcy and herself84.798843234005
  Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings3.791283939688207e+53
"  She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham2.7000972173401366e+26
 "You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing1.9267793562075692e+18
 Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered2.942518243371374e+17
"  "There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men6.214199336552586e+22
"  "I never thought Mr478208.2875037916
 It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind2.2672543243930096e+31
 I was uncomfortable enough227706.74274781207
 Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved5.041777916611024e+17
 To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever5.694405828931698e+18
 Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery1.5566826968653876e+55
 "And then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself2.8027874393344764e+47
"  "Oh, well! it is just as he chooses473551212364519.6
 _They_ will take care not to outrun their income2311732093342800.0
 _They_ will never be distressed for money100478805706827.34
 But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves2.7066375268595036e+16
 Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better3.117573805862301e+25
 _I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me1.3105462874350334e+19
   The first week of their return was soon gone87723944678168.17
 The second began1324304.287334152
  "I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away5.744967243791037e+24
"  "A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever207086494030313.62
  The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs5.975184797101275e+17
 Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home5.118189963501099e+34
"  "Already arisen!" repeated Mr60065164301.04229
 Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret1.944005814570534e+30
 Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly1.1070569443400476e+34
 Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,  "Do not make yourself uneasy, my love1.1590186768371573e+30
 Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance3.913746872393882e+21
 She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once2.1719291344410807e+93
  He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him8.13701167618083e+59
"  "Yes, very different40344.13487265038
 "In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was6.298184939034717e+17
 Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right2.7427165945861305e+35
 His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by3.6459741480648274e+51
 Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy1.0867679520169063e+29
 He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments9.657122632766868e+29
 It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment2.375831462036348e+74
"  The period of expectation was now doubled13678275177921.1
 Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival7.113858982547954e+18
  The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement4.513330620039391e+26
 are sufficiently known138326150.2024141
 Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated7.741038892922724e+76
  "My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt8.156346735398467e+28
 Wickham passed all his youth there, you know366158326724252.0
 They have some of the finest woods in the country43415027068713.58
 A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme1.1693969529724648e+87
     [Illustration: MATLOCK]     PRIDE AND PREJUDICE:  A Novel303675368.0737692
        London: Printed for T90.24603543860248
   Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter8.917961707220311e+48
 Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned5.642907671967389e+18
 She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste2.049207764956449e+39
 The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object1.8831960351628903e+41
 It was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago2.4307826007792944e+17
 Darcy?"  Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little492265122345.4643
"  "I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this7.65236741601758e+41
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Gardiner27.360418439559684
  "Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long3.795912891729203e+31
  "Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"  "Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months9.08532407617239e+50
 Darcy!" thought she942442.0515170827
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves5.001287490258327e+20
"  "That is not very likely; our authority was too good7.63137830680505e+16
  "He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows2.351888869135064e+19
 Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her2.4097231929623563e+22
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs87383482797.85805
  She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome3.2845967838496927e+35
 They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family1.873030601003019e+56
 And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting4.077069625860924e+90
 With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round8.617311633302428e+20
 It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts8.464717824803729e+62
 Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr3.573393968958369e+42
 Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance576524947153676.9
 Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph307215752942.8395
"  After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration9.106704993077247e+69
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together128287190032917.7
 After a short silence, the lady first spoke96273101487.77008
 Bingley and his sisters4295.221075232714
 She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her2.1115413751125388e+67
  They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought4.394850468301884e+19
 Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind45121777345408.195
  He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn1.3995534281062298e+30
 "He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle5.49336299394615e+19
 Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else2.3129351798227844e+71
 Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance2.1809567320040203e+63
   Elizabeth had settled it that Mr979841.3656847869
 But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came1.890539338731105e+31
  Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place2.6786893527311185e+20
 With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself4.514652633572487e+26
 They had long wished to see him158908299.4063922
 Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased2.2133664977591015e+22
 Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance8.544882487136695e+55
 But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane3.6928711698918144e+34
 No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard9.72335272445492e+16
 Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight2.6437211744296425e+32
 He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister1.4529720725862432e+104
 Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London332090110807776.75
  The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs4.673898429231501e+72
 Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement1.0634975286325205e+19
  Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more1.0054770428443014e+66
 Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully7.949679023259623e+61
  Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while Mr2.358697962918398e+23
 Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer6.3946586891269746e+53
 They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs2.265737284970501e+37
 Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs124776281.88018535
 How thankful am I,      that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must      forget it ourselves1.096690782612079e+39
 F26.66281758952031
 who instantly taking the alarm, set off      from B3.8943111947041644e+18
 I know not what to think494.6381800559106
 After making      every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F1.836727735633401e+20
 My father and mother believe the worst,      but I cannot think so ill of him242045847018399.66
 I grieve to      find, however, that Colonel F117615275686802.33
 Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed      their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot      wonder1.056059241221714e+33
 Darcy appeared2012.489399998842
 Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you8.161647063737298e+66
 Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose1.019603515665754e+25
 Wickham32.508982098346834
 They are gone off together from Brighton2172859449.617692
 _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest8448950350824.084
 But it is all, all too late now24385850706068.496
 Her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace1.4973086317829768e+42
 The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl1.0022401344185676e+22
 It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it3.2397502112554735e+25
 Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland155817299701327.1
"  "But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"  "Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all1.204057016582287e+49
  When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give3.764144018575407e+41
 The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage2.124769036267144e+87
  "If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her4.2842052528706846e+45
 Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia491513597049362.1
 And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married3.9821829598255623e+46
"  "Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm9.427350959360386e+38
 I am so grieved for him3964447.7897952725
 His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost22554304222278.645
 Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step5.063916660110946e+46
"  "Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it1.0945356575508571e+21
"  "Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you722246801305862.4
 She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us1.0755549030740964e+61
 Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied3.734010714315468e+19
   The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr28489697332.116848
 Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel2.2102638751894314e+43
 Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces2.0932296601886042e+36
 Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street1.5833802172605408e+53
 If there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence4.359839674214837e+42
 Collins and      myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable      family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest      kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove9.982299515960147e+55
      And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to      suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness      of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree      of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of      yourself and Mrs6.490480907184227e+70
 And this consideration leads me moreover to      reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last      November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in      all your sorrow and disgrace2.9869088190831104e+60
       "I am, dear Sir, &c91264064.37221566
 His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them2.836158893102881e+42
 And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount1.2316664231840324e+70
 Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton2.2588285626246503e+23
  "What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!" she cried1.1693225650790227e+17
 He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it2.1945184793234992e+43
  "This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away4.0683941922857516e+100
 No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village2.8317099258610087e+28
  "Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy7958925096.011657

       "EDW707148.2156882259
"  "Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished6560044676809.611
"  Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote7.952024583428203e+23
  "Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately679985096591016.0
"  "That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before4459264196355056.0
 He has children of his own, and may have more122654418670859.36
 The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited59749699558164.32
 He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied,  "Just as you please7.630933674698399e+23
 As soon as Jane had read Mr258038521.50267154
 To know that her daughter would be married was enough3760292343379.0664
"  "Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents8.254257128869619e+79
  "I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips2.823555722598507e+31
 This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving1.4182701190491286e+28
  That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible2.022941559303885e+52
 But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain1.710988489200368e+83
  It was a fortnight since Mrs68799920.8535026
 There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much1.7898917977866605e+51
 Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them3.4608582819146033e+39
  She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her5.164123373977789e+31
 To Mr77.36292384156303
 Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again2.1305761052706033e+49
 Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia162002035847.30884
       "It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon      as his marriage was fixed on9.667326231589909e+25
 Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much9.787589648305144e+33

     CHAPTER IX79.28044708716925
  They came139374.08163230473
 The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them174901994229855.22
  Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room4.980189161466968e+20
  Their reception from Mr130790.19502950223
 Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked234248507523117.0
 Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless1.9414032806991497e+28
 Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world6.189024163272011e+39
"  Her father lifted up his eyes34399277866.2392
 Wickham," by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to Mrs1.3617059312494589e+34
 They must all go to Brighton37341876.62753176
"  Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them9.418223616187387e+16
 Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home1.3698974721047794e+48
  Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him1.4046329327214964e+26
 He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country9.229417370743402e+38
 However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham2.1165352375142573e+32
 To be sure London was rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open1.5859701022567206e+24
 Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr1.1820393038652275e+34
 And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it3.7300362479244626e+21
 Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement570634983238.2777
 I must confess myself      surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_2.994833457991525e+20
 It was all      over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked      as _your's_ seems to have been1.3488651947111242e+37
 But      it was two or three days before he could get from her what he      wanted3.2101899704843003e+20
 Darcy's next step was      to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in      Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home1.9756811345748072e+34
 But at last your uncle was forced      to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,      was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,      which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your      letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an      explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give      the praise where it was due8.488246986137299e+107
 The reason why all this was to be done by him      alone, was such as I have given above5.424386966509874e+22
 I shall never be quite happy till I      have been all round the park1.3137184338229002e+16
 A low phaeton, with a nice little      pair of ponies, would be the very thing4.151718947399514e+27
 She was ashamed to think how much463863245.4995073
"  "True75.68418995477288
 I wonder what he can be doing there1112445726216.6633
"  "How should you have liked making sermons?"  "Exceedingly well1.3708721371082667e+21
"  "I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly8.411003265117452e+68
"  "You did! and it was not wholly without foundation17239150679403.486
 You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it1.7790416104210606e+19
 Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know25384163030.269505
 In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind2151518560911108.2
"  She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house3.1012416893325193e+35
     CHAPTER XI52.675062424389665
 Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth2.1151365072140735e+46
"  But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation1.9880215720873208e+63
 He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again2.7480379029883335e+19
 And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"  "You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs4.518427229394593e+25
 But don't imagine it was from any silly cause2.0204324983847593e+18
 I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him1.6967278908982462e+25
 Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks8.34986718965954e+22
 Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it8.569980970593991e+82
 They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them1.1062782853926922e+20
"  Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr1.4110470395970875e+48
"  "Good gracious! Mr10308.839571052866
 She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter3.487452878853543e+49
  The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken1.1315450684695605e+73
 But she would not be secure4213215.498604642
 On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance3.283810110799407e+54
  Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied1.4672509400646507e+61
  He readily agreed to it21859115.016486984
 to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing2.3839846090716893e+33
 It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it6.123082282854497e+28
 Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell682330466.1116725
 His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars9.611251320566101e+27
"  "My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now8.970628804859095e+18
"         *       *       *       *       *  They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs3.095826091867444e+18
 Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself1.2689594585498868e+28
 On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided6.273008391174272e+34
 He placed himself by her699072155.1826739
 He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr2.294341621102654e+41
 Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour1.2358992658316566e+26
 She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage6.274561140283971e+27
 Annesley is with her4675597.269861686
 They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself1.1153632445054373e+51
  Mrs9.62941339842944
  "Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you7.574416325274046e+40
 The venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch2.949232250992022e+31
 I hope we may often meet again23662634492.801704
  "Lizzy, you must not do so4833579.540079123
 You must not suspect me4534220.538852015

 Make haste, make haste7506535.493707863
 In a few minutes, Mrs43978.55460476807
"  Elizabeth was forced to go44337.62140433997
 "Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room2.322865779032164e+20
  Mrs9.62941339842944
  After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference1.856617391916991e+16
 Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs9409020599484676.0
 Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter4.0965985954568026e+23
 Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes2.8148256635692866e+54
 Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane259725256863492.4
  "I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried417967374126917.6
 "I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself2.759139127343396e+29
 Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"  She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty9.355202303908665e+73
 She will be down in a moment I dare say8067016176.4423065
"  He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister8.245131289391221e+30
  "You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled8.101992648174013e+25
 Jane was beyond competition her favourite child200764409265.4646
  Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur1.2424161902788914e+71
"  "That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever heard you utter9.656486418819108e+22
 Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard1.6275102511345595e+31
"  "Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"  "He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty4.107475257192272e+68
  Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him6.3661098116028e+49
  "I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried Jane6.121092021927123e+22
 "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but such another man for you!"  "If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you4.213860097108961e+84
 Mrs9.62941339842944
"  "Yes, very well3556.7123566912387
"  Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling2.450308876582911e+37
 But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled2.4368657719439788e+16
"  Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs4.6323788211795375e+29
 Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come2.3224221540221174e+23
 My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it3.697606610831228e+41
 Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you1.0995589017945882e+66
 What could your ladyship propose by it?"  "At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted2.8283183909061996e+32
"  "Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth, coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence3.505618096279954e+46
 Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied806763838715.6527
 You may have drawn him in14676764736.424267
"  "Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this1.0368547362486427e+25
"  "But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit1.427430682477475e+32
 If Mr1782.3007992681048
 Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all6.904900028314474e+39
 Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be1.588637670844457e+19
 You _are_ a gentleman's daughter350725856.5111091
"  "Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_2.2212879648975233e+28
"  "Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"  Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation,  "I am not4.388065756969489e+63
"  "And I certainly _never_ shall give it154621181244.26248
 Your ladyship wants Mr31841277.020210702
 Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make _their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged4.037373574065873e+118
 I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement2.004542011727074e+22
 I must beg to return to the house5065008.960339605
 You refuse, then, to oblige me33472006027.52567
"  "And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well6.187938939203266e+22
 You deserve no such attention154589511.1106156
"  "She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well8.380061381155821e+44
 I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"  Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible1.3991229635951362e+44
 Lady Catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr1.290545563318536e+44
 Darcy18.017419673323744
 And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible, at some future time1.0327269713693452e+79
  "If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand it1.2796913450651635e+38
 I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy5.490926728209873e+19
"  She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held9.124291882087226e+46
 This letter is from Mr13627325.336334284
 Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land3.456040253691154e+74
 Pray read on132675.49041590464
 But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it39757765710.93742
 For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"  "Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted4.876405876739691e+45
 And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"  To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it6.960172895163367e+76
 Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr1.69327061913322e+18
 Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out4.202563395390381e+54
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together2.199393311767529e+28
"  "I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness1.3603076329260324e+49
"  "If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone5.229902193227289e+19
 But your _family_ owe me nothing516363790185495.3
"  "We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said Elizabeth3.971540829458291e+24
 The adieu is charity itself210439892856.28708
 I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong7.35175504467753e+26
"  "My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to2.1786541376856703e+79
"  He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend1.0100403480831262e+116
  "I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth492086001696272.8
 When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen28618418750427.85
"  "That is to say, you had given your permission140837823841612.34
 I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent4.0063771591325445e+26
 I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection1.7722897804197027e+37
 Bingley is most unaffectedly modest207883072085.443
 I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him3.507839729592993e+39
 He has heartily forgiven me now12603854667.77879
     CHAPTER XVII79.28044708716925
 "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be46116872.86576089
 Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth3.416053086870586e+16
  "Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried Jane6.344825361635692e+25
"  "What do you mean?"  "Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley4.4661138324535457e+21
 I always had a value for him118966457.88649924
 But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me4.592169767701981e+19
"  Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy219009234111054.2
         *       *       *       *       *  "Good gracious!" cried Mrs29917880.04070861
"  "It may do very well for the others," replied Mr17222940849560.492
 As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs1299028204398.3298
 Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening669140802056.7759
 Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr6359937508.295713
 In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library1.379474692045127e+46
 "Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"  How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr5.514976464025826e+121
 He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane5.04327109200343e+28
"  "I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him9.280348935488866e+19
 Indeed he has no improper pride238100545800.48807
 I know your disposition, Lizzy90420487.430554
 I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy5.7589856944681016e+23
"  He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr5.156001287261506e+19
  "My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence9.210931164890398e+37
 Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow2.1522365166011364e+18
 "Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane's1.3791768569188008e+30
"     CHAPTER XVIII77.21224586946984
 Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her87636790304042.6
 It is too long ago718138.1242389209
"  "My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not1.3931276455787035e+60
"  "You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner8.009855291655056e+16
 _Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject? This will never do9.269808414414429e+56
 I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's2.571707477005742e+19
 But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected3.261092907460386e+18
 Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr8.014340732380506e+26
"  Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere1.48940224463994e+27
 She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard4.1950433287730565e+29
 Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved6.398861120201461e+46
 Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge5.49420522366258e+34
 He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St9.075184887314515e+50
 James's, with very decent composure91342842580.59155
     CHAPTER XIX52.675062424389665
 He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected3.457569259456111e+19
  Mr7.688630579355423
 In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great9.034660547953002e+22
 Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going4.420512304143936e+40
  Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth7.89950600832732e+88
