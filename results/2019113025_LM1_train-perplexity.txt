     CHAPTER I42.30409824657876
   It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife38537.168580679594
  "My dear Mr65.11131077699542
 Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"  Mr25807.010495457085
 Bennet replied that he had not2350.7730612758705
  "But it is," returned she; "for Mrs3618.5566159431783
 Long has just been here, and she told me all about it2329.334726415365
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Bennet made no answer83.99336519835227
  "Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently19039.61171058251
  "_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it53793.58120851364
"  This was invitation enough82.83269282647889
  "Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs4856.853273133188
 Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr3051675.665534808
 Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week529876.245455689
"  "What is his name?"  "Bingley2331.700664992239
"  "Is he married or single?"  "Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year3392339.135613226
 What a fine thing for our girls!"  "How so? how can it affect them?"  "My dear Mr71272.13397488756
"  "Is that his design in settling here?"  "Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes4917661668.076475
"  "I see no occasion for that469.7162757317242
 You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr60197.028550879
 Bingley might like you the best of the party304.6631451033559
"  "My dear, you flatter me365.0032302407388
 I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now100379.55424802957
 When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty1071.8637376382696
"  "But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr2639.6289138848965
"  "It is more than I engage for, I assure you1322.5339689741654
"  "But consider your daughters93.58119654228375
 Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them3009.019846171195
 Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers3113.2949515992887
 Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not57398.337311272924
"  "You are over scrupulous surely109.40955634679317
 I dare say Mr151.00115958533797
 Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy2716815.7794143064
"  "I desire you will do no such thing257.97938892003606
 Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia103611.51848028113
 But you are always giving _her_ the preference773.5515002307442
"  "Mr25.892549922914036
 Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me6023.274016464748
 You have no compassion on my poor nerves292.68629060589757
"  "You mistake me, my dear410.7318617398548
 I have a high respect for your nerves146.2690285712643
 I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least277.3102371731928
"  "Ah! you do not know what I suffer3419.2439189656147
"  "But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood66818.35991708907
"  "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them16928.42587560857
"  "Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all45665.07523488375
 Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character16247.852587038846
 She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper493.03939157692065
 When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous198.31231497092517
 The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news719.7777414315999
   Mr7.688630579355423
 Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr205.22476850794075
 Bingley32.63584333211581
 He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it1232897.6761764183
 It was then disclosed in the following manner151.73806590545297
 Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,  "I hope Mr11754.33799153307
 Bingley will like it Lizzy85.68204040946527
"  "We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr649.6713473194096
 Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit8734.382605884864
 Long has promised to introduce him162.57371337399758
 Long will do any such thing104.39774599736069
 She has two nieces of her own346.4694802286816
 She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her8689.62443415127
"  Mrs21.43911708981833
 Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters1513.5418166807192
  "Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves1242.2177817021743
 You tear them to pieces98.00338043671677
"  "Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill3870.2512731203497
"  "I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully4177.502251301387
  "When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"  "To-morrow fortnight9594.367375416867
 Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself964197.7415102767
"  "Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr68421.39561337636
"  "Impossible, Mr87.9156928283184
 Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?"  "I honour your circumspection564567.171507158
 A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little103.46961216931642
 One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight452.32271553793487
 Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself135991.55835625346
"  The girls stared at their father115.06030439587576
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!"  "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he34333.40075527722
 What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts14379.162181583988
"  Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how910.200570006865
  "While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr4158.874304398263
"  "I am sick of Mr192.2284855764811
 Bingley," cried his wife827.1143966403935
  "I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him2433495.8925530035
 It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now4440.504722428417
 Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while125924.87383477755
 Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now1652622.4563374047
 Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife250467.45993144822
  "What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut16267.367362715404
 "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter1890.377424288144
 At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing1308185.3898316417
 Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr2173.282254383658
 Bingley will dance with you at the next ball411.8548206977861
"  "Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, I'm the tallest106364.34922669058
"  The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr2868.5399093074593
 Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner304.99757267909723
     CHAPTER III52.66659867208486
   Not all that Mrs96.61204086374694
 Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr233041.30563980044
 Bingley32.63584333211581
 They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas254269.33498085424
 Her report was highly favourable88.97366850386923
 Sir William had been delighted with him108.42933329511153
 Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr3478.4570672387563
 Bingley's heart were entertained81.21926315697107
 Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for508234.62062543625
"  In a few days Mr342.1809312565043
 Bingley returned Mr81.83919647458188
 The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse16931.468469200183
 Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all422.66441011699663
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c256643.73103037407
 Bennet was quite disconcerted78.25795566842149
 She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be7190039.118238064
 Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly381.8977859838486
 The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin43258.45180322801
 And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr361.38587243802783
 Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man565.6862776463782
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners2172.2959891843298
 His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion784.7621705939943
 His brother-in-law, Mr111.51945441125261
 Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr381.61576900202414
 Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year336513.1031518674
 The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr10625.144071541337
 Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend96138926.72452979
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield84984.17873252222
 Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves149.41917670422478
 What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr311.1025733192786
 Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party3052067.909911713
 His character was decided93.29037826477153
 He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again61323.55390758577
 Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs123.43542131879859
 Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters1174.9215615482717
 Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr792.2465081385586
 Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it3549.1546242824147
  "Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance102466.94735850069
 I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner256.1512741095397
 You had much better dance138.19429222074226
"  "I certainly shall not132.02868591560667
 You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner523.515425779617
 At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable2341.4620681902816
 Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with1194019.0173789624
"  "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty1434436344.4478219
"  "_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr32922.81387527796
 Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet192.44927895387667
 Do let me ask my partner to introduce you176.32573156706493
"  "Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, "She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men2880140459.6168528
 You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me840.5507573836034
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Bingley followed his advice88.465320985906
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him707.6150247854316
 She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous3271.893084911014
  The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family250.58509504695573
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters10154.371708178545
 Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure90.8782948727192
 Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball3525114.86312105
 They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants6014.054865500546
 They found Mr78.73304877806615
 Bennet still up80.93981673855606
 With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations89298.99374806158
 He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear68291.0289959468
 Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball180665.22109493185
 I wish you had been there249.46727948060604
 Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it234.06679879531788
 Every body said how well she looked; and Mr122.42865528620318
 Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice164.0787647468622
 Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time1900803.2934536838
 First of all, he asked Miss Lucas342.04439001464766
 I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance231163106.07743153
 So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next3546.508947156397
 Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"  "Oh! my dear," continued Mrs346100.5710253083
 Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him2441.3797320066433
 He is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women299.3729504697957
 I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses839.3827163305307
 I dare say the lace upon Mrs250.6408008399881
 Hurst's gown----"  Here she was interrupted again2573.541068949572
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Bennet protested against any description of finery99.18674999372465
 She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr3112.0340635271523
 Darcy18.017419673323744
  "But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing50768458.33829661
 I quite detest the man98.16618245796431
"     CHAPTER IV51.5031401151251
   When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr5808.9305459952475
 Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him447.97466203288525
  "He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"  "He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can1747030754697.1787
 His character is thereby complete86.14191507851028
"  "I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time1124.9927153705887
 I did not expect such a compliment402.95849842634124
"  "Did not you? _I_ did for you1213.642451120396
 But that is one great difference between us258.92924308370357
 Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never15798.372980707407
 No thanks to his gallantry for that110.48063362568058
 Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him1398.7743081992367
 You have liked many a stupider person96.36048836613264
"  "Dear Lizzy!"  "Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general344246.97171175486
 You never see a fault in any body125.161455440532
 All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes256.27405228920816
 I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life766.245948631027
"  "I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think20629.610447739095
"  "I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder26364.055619321512
 With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where46074.24350137999
 But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone2636.5725600711967
 And so, you like this man's sisters too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his1271.0322443792766
"  "Certainly not; at first102.16131644520105
 But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them193.71489687920126
 Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her79615.35979682308
"  Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them189422388.66300318
 They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited36172.400611057536
 They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others324139062.35381776
 They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade1311.1381128031471
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it24076.861580182664
--Mr37.07530761059661
 Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase76574375.8281005
 Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her5005.752982308367
 Mr7.688630579355423
 He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately36012.02462519695
  Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character20042.718083747965
--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied30016.356947731514
 On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion3998.842408991501
 In understanding Darcy was the superior108.2561419294348
 Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever550.6272905792587
 Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence306.4916926276531
  The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic708.0608866258683
 Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful401134428.4741567
 Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure108787.45064071343
 Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much747.4371709688699
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of3534091.4526579855
 Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose7188.6469524978575
     CHAPTER V52.53769296248504
   Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate483.6040099964625
 The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly92.4375034806651
 It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world54834868.97817345
 For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body8986.440375236456
 James's had made him courteous132.91445817159897
  Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs8104.83434421811
 Bennet25.669748167391045
--They had several children95.30231674270995
  That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate67355.35300467449
  "_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs3597.1359407353807
 Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas159.42782008152386
 "_You_ were Mr277.62147526433677
 Bingley's first choice79.47216004088283
"  "Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better182.0206838884314
"  "Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice406.06244211374786
 Robinson78.78484491035462
"  "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr189.98940919747446
 Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr499.8652782563233
"  "Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know649.8765608178784
"  "_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said Charlotte63140.572315788726
 "Mr15.772602668744852
 Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_1226.3379488438513
"  "I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him244003.80784040113
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips1749.889679680184
"  "Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said Jane1235.144495362887
--"I certainly saw Mr189.77109716716748
 Darcy speaking to her99.34105242785019
"  "Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to90188.02763718668
"  "Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance94513.64202945505
 With _them_ he is remarkably agreeable263.32720287194326
"  "I do not believe a word of it, my dear8243.25398148208
 If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs3909.5760350571095
 Long51.7485417937919
 Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise2246.187849839669
"  "I do not mind his not talking to Mrs246.44898408218788
 Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza92905.97710572681
"  "Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_, if I were you11106520.216990884
"  "I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him6413.944042515993
 One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself29069.834432045307
 If I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud5421.511317629366
"  "That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_17215331.92105435
"  "Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing I believe12007.316644327886
 By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary904252326.8327943
 Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously436.0414642518135
 A person may be proud without being vain118.56948611229659
 Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us309.76258120213083
"  "If I were as rich as Mr286.6729754162505
 Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was62622.43810985627
 Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly22554.050975323957
     CHAPTER VI52.53769296248504
   The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield254.28639558264368
 The visit was returned in due form171.11653655393505
 Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the two eldest103535.27551942143
 By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration78460807.32075751
 It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent323764760630818.06
 She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas307.5342226210507
  "It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded10730790.473082095
 There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself16939.30903637306
 We can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement7359.614443740306
 In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels321.1951908728871
 Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on12637.090044349292
"  "But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow3229.8737672885395
 If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too56901.11342612974
"  "Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do25618.869032432856
"  "But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out21907.193677070758
"  "Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her717.5065369378545
 But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together2235728.7887680954
 Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention835.7726274714005
 When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses23095.130716387677
"  "Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it10107503.545225495
 But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design375.4819443276262
 As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness3233.762326776305
 She has known him only a fortnight113.25378805920649
 She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times35537.59825465928
 This is not quite enough to make her understand his character1730.445950543143
"  "Not as you represent it108.18038474629854
"  "Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded51950.612405375075
"  "Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth5684901331.901822
 Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance233.45692778171806
 If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least11043.306978494635
 They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life54449.973470720004
"  "You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound2412.2692414217163
 You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself27003.704333794714
"  Occupied in observing Mr90.20777770777781
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise1038307.2005285282
 But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes282188.12460540584
 To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying102.13185379753745
 Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness9597301.972487468
 Of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with29824.735659863876
  He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others185913.84329364347
 His doing so drew her notice89.88213892248613
 It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled625.834773930582
  "What does Mr87.01427644115765
 Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"  "That is a question which Mr1349702.8322969
 Darcy only can answer89.5162793128755
"  "But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about3849.581948074514
 He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him390713.02086253726
"  On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,  "Did not you think, Mr77809314.34199375
 Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?"  "With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic4775050.710949532
"  "You are severe on us161.60755468334145
 "I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows6770.61643673789
"  "You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers117534579.10100098
" On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must275415.11517616245
" And gravely glancing at Mr88.35529114934226
"  Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital525.1448569057819
 After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display48110653.9128085
  Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached123956.15170244707
 Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began3401857.2995725907
  "What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr184.97312451051496
 Darcy!--There is nothing like dancing after all106.98498893023415
--I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies1625.0127408629492
"  "Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world500.211397058764
"  Sir William only smiled104.7347639806788
 "Your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr8080.435015947229
 Darcy18.017419673323744
"  "You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir594.4987861402823
"  "Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight634.3269505105391
 Do you often dance at St102.06727469608886
"  "Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"  "It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it2281098.3813350336
"  "You have a house in town, I conclude?"  Mr1426.0112119387747
 Darcy bowed81.34789599176993
  "I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas24735.490709594167
 Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner3705.35000735094
--You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you2802.131021415504
" And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr1105.0789112830505
 Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,  "Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing213483111.25218773
--I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner904.5949294503877
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain1740.8103821742525
 Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion248.3934974500324
  "You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour486556721.89841425
"  "Mr25.892549922914036
 Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling1557.8055163461854
 Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,  "I can guess the subject of your reverie4722206.7429538425
"  "I should imagine not115.324442326913
"  "You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion9130.403190616738
 I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"  "Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you61364.33063609737
 My mind was more agreeably engaged106.8958834828739
 I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow3724.1501043727635
"  Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections2707.2258549297853
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy replied with great intrepidity,  "Miss Elizabeth Bennet390.21476077831807
"  "Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley270.2196463248842
 How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you joy?"  "That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask68572.75986426108
 A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment424.8846720137811
 I knew you would be wishing me joy158.53275436920453
"  "Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled147038.9920096918
 You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you40427.770114784726
"  He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long178742.67929134003
     CHAPTER VII52.53769296248504
   Mr7.688630579355423
 Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his207330.47981284294
 Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds4539.641293862096
  She had a sister married to a Mr258.2339021609992
 Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade284262.82382626337
  The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way132776.2292459025
 The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt19943430.10499729
 At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters1169082.9925279052
  Their visits to Mrs82.89743057363843
 Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence291.91610720381897
 Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections491.36670554179756
 Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves4128.67544733343
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before917.6356954286194
 They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr259.42679425732655
 Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign1672.3068199835052
  After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr403.5532956952188
 Bennet coolly observed,  "From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country57079.87791451826
  "I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs2179.6501697481463
 Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly12314.735256493206
 If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however1972.878946951085
"  "If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it885.4387385647657
"  "Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever677.1773230588665
"  "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree9458.0629821315
 I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish11602.812965600393
"  "My dear Mr89.49089150920096
 Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother21364.683707143187
--When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do2965.9717536783696
 I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals15396130.447080707
"  "Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library129478.76017337533
 Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer16117.753346082638
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,  "Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love145237666.61762884
"  "It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud177712.42777303
       "My dear Friend,       "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and      me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our      lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never      end without a quarrel3985901.1064696875
 Come as soon as you can on the receipt of      this1612.784563474859
 My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers877.6268685426901
      Yours ever,       "CAROLINE BINGLEY109.87540244398767
"  "With the officers!" cried Lydia662.7661192219435
 Bennet, "that is very unlucky893.6443400620217
"  "Can I have the carriage?" said Jane2767.0508162375722
  "No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night334429.94864338066
"  "That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home325301.2775422698
"  "Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr266.07179984586674
 Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs2199.403469815031
"  "But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure3402.8988299559974
 Bennet, are not they?"  "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them8362.893754156055
"  "But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered19047.706442639173
"  She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged415.4646293899332
 Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day33972.27563077071
 Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard1196.9692106929972
 The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back413.60117963147286
  "This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs975.2533299545995
 Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own4120.021815775144
 Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance396368.5953890961
 My kind friends will      not hear of my returning home till I am better310.6653938789109
 They insist also on      my seeing Mr95.40806165067211
 Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear      of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache      there is not much the matter with me9693.559652097543
       "Yours, &c56.91311908865893
"  "Well, my dear," said Mr1467.625600501142
 Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr25884291.97338168
 Bingley, and under your orders120.6993020889939
"  "Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying8314.772871699091
 People do not die of little trifling colds107.26098404980496
 As long as she stays there, it is all very well2971.7267036009725
 I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage10487.398792340658
"  Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative10484889.257855987
  "How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there233162101.84892222
"  "I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want997.8346863968942
"  "Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?"  "No, indeed2296668.44712178
 I do not wish to avoid the walk1015.0243635809993
 The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles175.12751621981909
 I shall be back by dinner170.3133942024177
"  "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required808461.6798413156
"  "We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia92709.67419828294
--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together3496.9333982444023
  "If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes99446.13973620597
"  In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise14523331.184278158
--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs50145.40618810985
 Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it3914.222535354333
 She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness258926.31277988196
--Mr37.07530761059661
 Darcy said very little, and Mr253.71174142573534
 Hurst nothing at all104.99541964457016
 The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone4454.257917077965
 The latter was thinking only of his breakfast105.64504615196618
  Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered195.630643245453
 Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room8771.67392041798
 She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with149505.94340941668
 Elizabeth silently attended her93.4713464853794
  When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane505968.05600082554
 The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts153759678.9382109
 The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely3628.547563634089
 Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere22876.62611220306
  When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so2478.3011019330265
     CHAPTER VIII42.21969295599913
   At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner1288.8167895287258
 To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr12868.113972081277
 Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer4277.924532149426
 Jane was by no means better400.8627431654778
 His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others31957.390420938056
 She had very little notice from any but him149.76488723526816
 Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr162.16693388638348
 Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr1078.3714253486712
 Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her106794.18015935394
  When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room1331175.6203678432
 Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty42829.67702769648
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Hurst thought the same, and added,  "She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker373920.4987676117
 I shall never forget her appearance this morning186.2670525741759
"  "She did indeed, Louisa318.7140408786326
 I could hardly keep my countenance211.82815685483786
 Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"  "Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office7059468114.344805
"  "Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was all lost upon me29425.90473143047
 Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice85.36001592549947
"  "_You_ observed it, Mr299.63145011451263
 Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition21561212.133119848
"  "Certainly not80.23179644231955
"  "To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum343619.9000494266
"  "It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley29641.185877569234
 Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes336005.90342202527
"  "Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise16862.595254942367
"--A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs375.4569772099093
 Hurst began again81.74104153728047
  "I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled89211.65078697634
 But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it165266.47843314736
"  "I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton4272.257830503637
"  "Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside758.6055465821526
"  "That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily13590.339641964341
"  "But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy69084.26104595786
  To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations8688.552560207858
 She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself321183563.1308737
 Hurst looked at her with astonishment333.36103739658034
  "Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular15448.694475085143
"  "Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards11858.603037626499
 She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else736.2305362873497
"  "I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things1862508.5428132974
"  "In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well1963765.4609646956
"  Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying2711.6039831006074
 He immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded227.79311049344696
  "And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into7588210.455638013
"  Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room1433.180615774236
--What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr340.39323356731535
 Darcy!"  "It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations1217716.6064885282
"  "And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books2512.600295824996
"  "I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these300.15006924520327
"  "Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place3178.39086965123
 Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley11734.756691183593
"  "I wish it may208.36917741220972
"  "But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model4173.562740247032
 There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire232.3186227446493
"  "With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it486.96552549897143
"  "I am talking of possibilities, Charles157.66500384649837
"  "Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation2329.1150525791086
"  Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr37377.404874383414
 Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game640.8463199228235
  "Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will she be as tall as I am?"  "I think she will2436790.1060237163
 She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller126.62147829651668
"  "How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much1810.3264322054558
"  "It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are1433610.082838443
"  "All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"  "Yes, all of them, I think1073282.0426974993
 They all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses94.96582537792405
"  "Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth11956.333146558782
 The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen289.62564147875236
 But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general1744.1815677096652
 I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished7133.867036436234
"  "Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley13568.553047978274
  "Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman195312.54315894475
"  "Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it917.6911893600193
"  "Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with12475.744042715956
"  "All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading1636831.4929657069
 I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_95.94962548978253
"  "Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?"  "_I_ never saw such a woman3710246.900411641
 _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united5785.684234926058
"  Mrs21.43911708981833
 Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr999.0199271073747
 Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward287.77805359111187
 As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room393.20709572859323
  "Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds1111876217.439643
 But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art7177.551118128077
"  "Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation50307.218811991646
 Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable88.97441503585816
"  Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject2916.781744088818
  Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her139992.51679824246
 Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians6463.282533978285
 This, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr2550272.3811726654
 Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better1357.7107918405038
     CHAPTER IX79.28044708716925
   Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr946446.4475519402
 In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation258305.4075677256
 The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with141.54168164504833
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast207.8649259633168
  Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs122.21097251056639
 Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield507931.53042630426
 She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable3828.4212600922137
 After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour1699.887886180786
 Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs105.55916857375716
 Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected254.30498553340908
 "She is a great deal too ill to be moved995.3462009280944
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Jones says we must not think of moving her456.22294074068645
 We must trespass a little longer on your kindness220.44892928225704
"  "Removed!" cried Bingley688.0398660926535
 "It must not be thought of259.36499289470214
 My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal7332.528842170786
"  "You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us1877548.2024133776
"  Mrs21.43911708981833
  "I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with6799836611200.495
 I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_368.4364860008244
 You have a sweet room here, Mr183.65875554025527
 Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk572.0101744731618
 I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield1782.7070579442443
 You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease30857.50844718514
"  "Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes303247.59087770083
"  "That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth6745.170459685953
"  "I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful47721.83686647851
"  "That is as it happens199.61197268613103
 It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours423.06048461456703
"  "Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home318790.05119613145
 It must be an amusing study368.8182075436474
"  "Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing149.88031558471505
 In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society332.7093667095201
"  "But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever1580.5511710825012
"  "Yes, indeed," cried Mrs1416.8507483393205
 Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood259.8790675048189
 "I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town35743.45801603577
"  Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away10972.505111751716
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph233.18695964431816
  "I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places1387.2198440964926
 Bingley?"  "When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same2191730522.3090644
"  "Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother22030.138390472042
 "You quite mistook Mr89.12060046079063
 Darcy18.017419673323744
 He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true70903.91661997899
"  "Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger133346.82352360408
 I know we dine with four and twenty families110.36180839970696
"  Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance179.12492873287493
 His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr265.96725817399266
 Darcy with a very expressive smile171.91961346387336
 Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away27319.64264367568
  "Yes, she called yesterday with her father700.3897518679687
 What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr127.09734805720971
--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter1484.5002690677131
"  "Did Charlotte dine with you?"  "No, she would go home17960.79883010267
 I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies106.1012973603196
 For my part, Mr140.28038648826075
 Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently3069.3233427080113
 But every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you22948.65737793178
 It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend6507.285541757082
"  "She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley3084.196519094216
  "Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain766.2601257422963
 Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty188.02753013114554
 It is what every body says194.99022050598072
 I do not trust my own partiality246.20085283485332
 But however he did not323.51635678039395
 Perhaps he thought her too young106.5020014311429
 However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were9191.26684028019
"  "And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently2607.3462809222424
 "There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way1575.4473477487127
 I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"  "I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy1311222.5589586059
  "Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may134.3823781582551
 Every thing nourishes what is strong already95.31489023149892
 But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away7553.955886234752
"  Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again1636.3898012666523
 She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs61907.07387489489
 Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr98.97127067185723
 Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy4487.579102914527
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required2706.7457315641313
 She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs114.84878883573917
 Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage255.8831920222695
 Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward420.8368804618207
 The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr1194033.8935846884
  Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age16428.423314651714
 She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance531672.4424311357
 She was very equal therefore to address Mr152.8363356873245
 Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it8293424.682697456
 His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear193.71943491337913
  "I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball872127.7402808525
 But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill745.308215956337
"  Lydia declared herself satisfied98.45568002539015
 "Oh! yes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again16012.475439647664
 And when you have given _your_ ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also109651.6061129847
 I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not4346.296231261644
 Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_9553429.46081306
     CHAPTER X42.21969295599913
   The day passed much as the day before had done573.9283509129209
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room230720.22420988325
 The loo table, however, did not appear2662.0914029372257
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister153311.7292765693
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Hurst and Mr75.5842334212325
 Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs107.91746945304097
 Hurst was observing their game84.9049971197945
  Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion2751.5835321457826
  "You write uncommonly fast89.91301413032541
"  "You are mistaken109.15245871865069
 I write rather slowly83.09059749663453
"  "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!"  "It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours9356873.794172078
"  "Pray tell your sister that I long to see her470.70704233538413
"  "I have already told her so once, by your desire499.4392427754953
 Let me mend it for you97.45058346312554
 I mend pens remarkably well89.52037304745878
"  "Thank you--but I always mend my own103.30445079548197
"  "How can you contrive to write so even?"  He was silent833.7415980819217
"  "Oh! it is of no consequence754.9803626436776
 I shall see her in January140.43051427011056
 But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr544.9757018408573
 Darcy?"  "They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine56034.26019481933
"  "It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill11573.637612388426
"  "That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease85800.52052376115
 He studies too much for words of four syllables216.463119968823
--Do not you, Darcy?"  "My style of writing is very different from yours11405.274816973404
 He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest177.01126828862996
"  "My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents5580.3429843606855
 Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof1253.2718708113894
"  "Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility20389.88318337381
 It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast573.633518649228
"  "And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"  "The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting525211.8945519152
 The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance2017.037580558562
 When you told Mrs123.36468510774094
 Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"  "Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning23955122252.95051
 And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment41161.04701951227
"  "I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity339557.8250650615
 Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month33991834.35873983
"  "You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr24931.090547087308
 Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition889.3372135652884
 You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself316.1310619243154
"  "I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper53212.48571167029
 But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could14483141.423366265
"  "Would Mr86.21860817931957
 Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"  "Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for himself18504.037915054487
"  "You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged4332.553496412658
 Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety639157950.518244
"  "To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you235.44866639000503
"  "You appear to me, Mr536.406097881128
 A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it304.6409514715105
 I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr1654.7186005278368
 Bingley32.63584333211581
 We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon3885.0222994839132
 But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"139850.32122616825
   "Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"80825.11514567108
  "By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of3854930.6044452526
 I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference39521.623901848616
 I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do588538.3907831953
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh32298.76009320923
 Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense754.0512830686242
  "I see your design, Bingley," said his friend3050.5522711435533
--"You dislike an argument, and want to silence this279.58222269961266
 Arguments are too much like disputes153.63687888841432
"  "What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr61672.862903776135
 Darcy had much better finish his letter131.7174568118044
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter163.9378944598871
 Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself7822.002375068798
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr33473.8827208877
 Darcy's eyes were fixed on her145.15919900616123
 She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange2276556.4437485887
 She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present168548.57892003775
 The supposition did not pain her96.38405134843512
 She liked him too little to care for his approbation247.1086326874732
  After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr610.0959986246645
 He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence372.1390846616863
  "Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply723332.7349442133
 You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt655120.8890600184
 I have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare39642.789280679885
"  "Indeed I do not dare689.7779255142141
 He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger3164.3718749768123
  Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth10309.369098902305
  She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance893.321328175933
  "I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers12827751108.651659
--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses7313.601231003212
 Put them next to your great uncle the judge126.26393363187859
 They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines2502.760404666919
 As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"  "It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied708749861.3835474
"  At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs764.729642680856
 Hurst and Elizabeth herself90.93174848836432
  "You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs161.30154944162504
 Hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out1163.5052109035541
"  Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr93.01660638754909
 Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself134.8231687443541
 The path just admitted three83.490307590404
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,--  "This walk is not wide enough for our party1567.568319753258
 We had better go into the avenue237.18826656881708
"  But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered,  "No, no; stay where you are774769.714362169
--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage117.3462440790719
 The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth96.99872939396688
 Good bye53.27412258155672
"  She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two9431.129049249634
     CHAPTER XI52.675062424389665
 Their powers of conversation were considerable94.75842889752182
  But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object2716.3750646128638
 Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps29506.20495893285
 He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr7859.377119233499
 Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation11633.77338306046
 He was full of joy and attention100.68923309390084
 The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door2199429.0186909963
 Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain102.79949413463771
 She had obtained private intelligence that Mr85.37052876183499
 Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr184.19366310956272
 Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected94.80620326274254
 She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her270747.3556365889
 Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs165.8614304002883
 Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet533.2467892439279
  Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr267.49134018771025
 She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on14616.769572086601
 At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library274460979944.1795
"  No one made any reply136.85259205963538
 She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,  "By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure5978381737.233383
"  "If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards2302214103.879679
"  "I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting821331.1332682717
"  "Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball143603.58829274404
 Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious9872.298952053912
--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude2669.9755849516805
"  Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately192.92633276840772
 Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr441.00470024229605
 Darcy looked up85.59716510493048
 He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book1283.4529669456222
 He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere148925.51274342916
 "What could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?  "Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it109120053.09895782
"  Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr3493.4471032498527
  "I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak218135.2472054317
 "You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire488559.3500394724
"  "Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley553.1914069899137
 "I never heard any thing so abominable380.6329733205134
 "We can all plague and punish one another140.78969557555556
 Teaze him--laugh at him87.97144996912365
--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done7588.858335578275
"  "But upon my honour I do _not_610.0131625924588
 I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_1055.335790520392
 Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no--I feel he may defy us there594.7383600912572
 And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject4420.975690261252
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy may hug himself77.29308851318413
"  "Mr25.892549922914036
 Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth1532.8319521085866
"  "Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be16074.908349382438
 The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke11756.715077232642
"  "Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of _them_368420.651490043
 I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good158.6437302440842
--But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without895.850629081819
 But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule1209.2946400324022
"  "Such as vanity and pride189.9455813068368
"  Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile118.96570475951707
 Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"  "I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr1049498.4991466503
 Darcy has no defect86.57469031685608
 He owns it himself without disguise90.78276156228965
"  "No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension5308.090241487139
 I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding3673.586497094145
--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world259.4526083375085
 I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself1639.5142462473777
 My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them219.22893190280098
 My temper would perhaps be called resentful103.09330321996173
--My good opinion once lost is lost for ever123.84077170026775
"  "_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth272.59709626975086
--I really cannot _laugh_ at it103.88790775294211
 You are safe from me93.05739276069382
"  "There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome9363.922826834407
"  "And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body580.0260454026003
"  "And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them9433.654390317897
"  "Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share47000.97869511695
--"Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr1276.6783499987275
"  Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it1023647.5996045553
 He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention291.9636148309337
     CHAPTER XII42.21969295599913
   In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day840198.7748249698
 But Mrs53.40104713505464
 Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home43986.820872730124
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr29513.95557511094
 Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well2736.9944839312407
--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr369598.08260388713
 Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made71862.66845185925
  The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred10016.078004888399
 Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other10890.453920278636
  The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right59044417.14836217
 Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough225.14474345164197
 She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself11211.27396045364
 He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it76794.27444929558
 Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her8522778.959487164
  On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place354.3675263539081
 Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former15649978.124445459
--Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits1985.5081781327867
  They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother165.94271376948555
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again8501.737043038585
 The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth120902.43841273601
  They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to8915.5537982469
 Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort610.3083229555792
     CHAPTER XIII78.18617665945537
   "I hope, my dear," said Mr4368.578128120065
 Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party44845738.768928245
"  "Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her47772595.18073433
"  "The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger2775.3700249079234
" Mrs21.43911708981833
 Bennet's eyes sparkled72.03702789407618
 Bingley I am sure241.27338260894422
 Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr90097.52988733405
 Bingley32.63584333211581
--But--good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day882.1222367443588
 Lydia, my love, ring the bell192.08057433960263
 I must speak to Hill, this moment168.7951587645113
"  "It is _not_ Mr417.6839261012802
 Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life369070.20803225785
"  This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once9343.946263042031
  After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained208.27952120019293
 "About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention28245.979140309842
 Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases66368.02605885094
"  "Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned186709.55378458003
 Pray do not talk of that odious man224.6077385335141
 I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it1223297865.898629
"  Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail1216.9953170315716
 They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs3602.228520481994
 Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about201443.22385712084
 Bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr346.54506102550505
 Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn96.36194518927465
"  "No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical146919200.12756306
 I hate such false friends85.85360673641553
 Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?"  "Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear9239880.01129689
"       _Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,       15th October109.25168570921024
_       DEAR SIR,       The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured      father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the      misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the      breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing      lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good      terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at      variance3066258775.3707533
--"There, Mrs121.25966170627451
 Bennet25.669748167391045
"--My mind however is now made up on      the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been      so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right      Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,      whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable      rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to      demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be      ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are      instituted by the Church of England1066596518.8215635
 As a clergyman, moreover, I      feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in      all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds      I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly      commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the      entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,      and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch1001778454.6703486
 I cannot be      otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your      amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to      assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but      of this hereafter350672.918551847
 If you should have no objection to receive me      into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on      you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and      shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday      se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as      Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a      Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the      duty of the day156568322.4092217
"  "At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said Mr7791.2405733823225
 Bennet, as he folded up the letter415.7683297905635
 "He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again1672977.6664803892
"  "There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him1809708.9900943215
"  "Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit82236.95330948572
"  Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required4603.061616971156
 "I cannot make him out187.59579898466689
--There is something very pompous in his style275.53094274355504
--And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could10438.274421763486
--Can he be a sensible man, sir?"  "No, my dear; I think not58372.89611323268
 I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse125.07622187821919
 There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well985.5805513653899
 I am impatient to see him378.9443237304954
"  "In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem defective11924.15476798843
 The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed5626.334770790338
"  To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting1110.103072034724
 Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters42592.27574057766
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr5056.054836683483
 Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself267.5434412550156
 He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty1020.8541000084455
 His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal1474.4062764339583
 He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs441.71790983917094
 Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage1813180.5405500212
 This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs1579.5211548316508
 Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,  "You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough5060679.791788819
 Things are settled so oddly94.54102883794599
"  "You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate184.48820597292016
 It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess1532.9042335335903
 Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world3468.5430592039406
"  "I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate752547.3560798188
 But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them863.8563833571105
 At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted----"  He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other2394512.4588054237
 They were not the only objects of Mr235.19610305884441
 Collins's admiration76.96535669296932
 The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs27257.804146934264
 Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property418.17430987001006
 The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing5513.437070618387
 But here he was set right by Mrs94.1541304685236
 He begged pardon for having displeased her94.28927466537147
 In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour7666.178232857757
   During dinner, Mr100.10901911932649
 Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable1406.2684871890747
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins was eloquent in her praise125.55765000662738
 The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine37286510.41670216
 She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening99318.53646061393
 Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her7743.06950392156
 She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations566839.3894915165
 She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs2401139.771324485
  "That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs20649.808728678916
 It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her423.1719241395765
 Does she live near you, sir?"  "The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence72291.74617901778
"  "I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?"  "She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property2292124.963258651
 Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls231.26952824049079
 And what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?"  "She is a most charming young lady indeed64240.07877105971
 Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth24646.384699358678
 She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them148732.38693741366
 But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies543.1267176649017
"  "Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court1907.895769284334
"  "Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament76717.35487564106
 Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies42913.31239040461
 I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her3864288.646161929
"  "You judge very properly," said Mr447.5490437717962
 Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy1544.0840372027242
 May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"  "They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible16804211.830131248
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Bennet's expectations were fully answered81.47169826874327
 His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure628060.6907054563
  By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr120.10576528027472
 Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies48166.18725112392
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels167019.98140242853
--Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed1330.2568400498892
--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons427.93757018908326
 Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,  "Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him4568040.689932938
 My aunt told me so herself on Saturday164.24202329000644
 I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr23343.320218113153
 Denny comes back from town92.91554906041597
 Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,  "I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit37159.51076546196
 But I will no longer importune my young cousin130.25013566600944
 Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon141.40839933104897
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements251.96907928232565
 Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr14663.388500750978
 Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr519.5586364391295
 Bennet, and prepared for backgammon156.2592443967381
     CHAPTER XV42.21969295599913
   Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance210747601.61773145
 The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity4147054.4973000125
 A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility1602713527.8669176
  Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report103915881.35036404
 This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part5456.587252422357
  His plan did not vary on seeing them222.06024323390753
 The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs7825.179978631603
 Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on91294.34359172909
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while Mrs206.7020212504176
 Bennet was stirring the fire82.287392643542
 Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course238.24259293936674
 Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces24791262.14355987
 Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr439.07374327113286
 Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr46424.62551179417
 Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr21417.41183405933
 Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford946.7523843356273
 Such doings discomposed Mr80.77837571233714
 In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr101574700.23972744
 Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr189.72431385631725
 Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go930.6362558627171
  In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton2544.0220096046405
 The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_1845.0291819390152
 Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them40337.637416547084
  But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way153605.69127130555
 The officer was the very Mr99.91804733178901
 Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed2769.3439130632864
 All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot1416137.8184882638
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps105785.73084773358
 This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming6150.531485738236
 His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address44601.682585116505
 The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street3752997.0112403147
 On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities6607.247064793266
 Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object549.5100458480221
 He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her4815.403986930735
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting140891562.27965724
 Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red191.5213832525787
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr740.1440256117908
 Darcy just deigned to return96.6342350341321
 What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know34587.628573221285
  In another minute Mr82.12345056026155
 Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend1387.083281218408
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr2145.9279257754406
 Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs1513883.8583297026
 Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation193.52990421830907
 Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr5485511741.17232
 Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr2134088.634612251
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire673308.5659708714
 She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr433199.3682537183
" Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr85913.08069970865
 Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening2711.359868151566
 This was agreed to, and Mrs149.46155779735196
 Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards4870.742764289867
 The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits1470.8601386704356
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless21120.920044043447
  As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister2489917.2252039746
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs186.08589450765396
 Bennet by admiring Mrs82.94199510453431
 Philips's manners and politeness80.74266596250746
 Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life164935.61848619487
   As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr2696.1196299763697
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr1084111.8315754018
 Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house3167.567882499762
 Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs7908773.779451785
 Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room7805291.512309989
  In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs23718066.06200872
 Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could92827.36482798342
 To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long325660.7853065176
 It was over at last however102.68618624653143
 The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr541.5179472651864
 Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration251380.06977735684
 Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room7870.127408350645
 Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker790600544.8149463
  With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr567.8662317942923
 Wickham and the officers, Mr218.6943341712006
 Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs6982.818589261644
 Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin1197.9235568613863
  When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist4072.015307339947
  "I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs75725430.1331197
 Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason324.4097958161493
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia3474.5074549690876
 At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular1158546.9171550265
 Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr389.60212695199874
 Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr25903189.732501157
 Darcy18.017419673323744
 She dared not even mention that gentleman137.40282218216518
 Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved95.68674201771155
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Wickham began the subject himself95.15732750376277
 He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr4581.38870762774
 Darcy had been staying there91.59836337179422
  "About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand35494762.42418359
"  "Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one2589.5341218776116
 A clear ten thousand per annum88.3499183323245
 You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy93111.37231625337
  "You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday41597.182625518886
--Are you much acquainted with Mr109.86529367237215
 Darcy?"  "As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable631258808.6884227
"  "I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise430123.02226550155
 I am not qualified to form one168.24653543095616
 I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge1017.1001498292155
 It is impossible for _me_ to be impartial1125.254671162721
 But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else4058.7763133299422
"  "Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield3090.4756648728862
 He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire565.3449295419991
 Every body is disgusted with his pride150.24218509564528
 You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one344.02873149938506
 The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen1368.857499350555
"  "I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man10193.010304006057
" Wickham only shook his head118.61519478914518
  "I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer1914526.940426965
"  "I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield27147.939873822725
 I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood125017.16441447377
"  "Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr1440.7202726720318
 Darcy18.017419673323744
 If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go7074.693110168692
 We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is116937731.15250717
 His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr1063.9545769887604
 Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr1776689.67523465
 Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections135.66767736014097
 His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father33418.34750562161
"  Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry6008.880170762695
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry51346.68098700325
  "It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire965478.328332901
 I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them630653.1146961022
 Society, I own, is necessary to me156.43491267667667
 I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude3929.3608377945916
 I _must_ have employment and society202.82047325567186
 The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now4577368.287815586
"  "Indeed!"  "Yes--the late Mr633.3627157928887
 Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift226.24022267867963
 He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me228.29747214812818
 I cannot do justice to his kindness162.73709905006936
 He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere363585.79828070226
"  "Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?"  "There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law35309837.50312962
 A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr1421.845219403505
 Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing27325.955857824694
 I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely265233.5616105036
 I can recal nothing worse89.72865266524646
 But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me7275.072593484699
"  "Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_3808.133969640047
 Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_3138.3120764002347
"  Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them1152.4589964736288
 Had the late Mr86.76977158745709
 Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life5915.026978475324
 He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me2754.2960747407
"  "I had not thought Mr347.66514654281855
 Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"  After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper1236969151673.5903
 His disposition must be dreadful140.04757416751445
"  "I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can hardly be just to him343402.4466400816
"  Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"  "We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care809511023611212.9
 _My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr453.2954520194542
 Philips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr1717.8605593510283
 Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property438.3078914679652
 He was most highly esteemed by Mr95.37696256619638
 Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend214.149330005521
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, Mr1709.9170316561206
 Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself482107.1852032464
"  "How strange!" cried Elizabeth715.0046966604436
 "How abominable!--I wonder that the very pride of this Mr135.73538277805258
"  "It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend482.1818530268479
 It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling223.50969425350624
 But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride21047.211597486767
"  "Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"  "Yes3024.0952975661385
 Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this30397.983681979193
 Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive7481.804090247118
 He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers205637.37093900886
"  "What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"  He shook his head6430.868203216881
--"I wish I could call her amiable369.5132638113481
 It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy564.8046459089966
 But she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud269.057817292654
--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement174143.97736252035
 But she is nothing to me now204.7439513644447
 Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education7911.026692244528
"  After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,  "I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr468496.2777224796
 Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other?--Do you know Mr24677.689792974004
 Bingley?"  "Not at all1649.0249652292412
"  "He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man982.2765167986277
 He cannot know what Mr124.00128896585315
 Darcy is75.2499765086717
"  "Probably not;--but Mr82.84583809097151
 Darcy can please where he chuses100.47871771837441
 He does not want abilities256.6668980209178
 He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while143.0877100709823
 Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous36891.68470779342
 His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure22040.929642354724
"  The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr1291.456486575543
 Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs120.2033228623384
 Philips78.80791003753109
--The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter310.2952014667071
 It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs6591.262999107968
 Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy1755300.829222067
  "I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object17442288.437981248
 There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters274570.65158666746
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr335.6524133312481
 Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh10743.129001507801
  "Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living24426.387932051293
 I hardly know how Mr216.77118849100276
 Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long647.6871062027719
"  "You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr4789.8716703455275
 Darcy18.017419673323744
"  "No, indeed, I did not2205.628610256701
--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections1026.6562200789808
 I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday908.0882228314573
"  "Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates439102.4710389735
 Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another54314.28354303934
 Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman496521322.0968116
"  "I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent1093717165.4783552
 She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class4967001.139441261
"  Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr5902087.029017875
 Wickham's attentions78.05482368941585
 There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs228.0297028315988
 Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body1096.2519560641488
 Elizabeth went away with her head full of him154.99622489089572
 She could think of nothing but of Mr189.16203591928561
 Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr1387191.0411457394
 Collins were once silent84.16681320621991
 Collins, in describing the civility of Mr93.5175972995411
 Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House345444.09932102286
 Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that Mr403.29287912455976
 Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr187.76584335987658
 Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham80890.28706610971
--The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained27570349.80301543
  "They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea1158921.708036591
 Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other273.70574821698807
 It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side8895.573129012148
"  "Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody2752811.2197229364
"  "Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion16164.115077130291
 Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for14923.70788752971
--It is impossible188.87770922850902
 No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it4261.953218710177
 Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? oh! no676.168139465543
"  "I can much more easily believe Mr146.72727170706347
 Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr148.8170039270435
--If it be not so, let Mr144.70530389906543
 Darcy contradict it82.65464941132903
 Besides, there was truth in his looks481.19339651240347
"  "It is difficult indeed--it is distressing179.9849621756311
--One does not know what to think557.1756820603548
"  "I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think157.36411538785967
"  But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr187.25775038098928
  The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr147471.84208619807
 The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation22855.173882385865
 To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs1196.1379807781714
 Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others85928.62007799288
 They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs584.1569679259612
 Bennet's civilities76.90062633669855
  The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family840.829834246597
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr22557.18041768875
 Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card293.58423610405487
 Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr4159.427647597447
 Darcy's looks and behaviour117.84463488425246
 The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr12368.062059065038
 Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball326645.8516475311
 And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it1456.0549493761541
  "While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough29892.51219509031
--I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements430.26509884389833
 Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body12412.46791907255
"  Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr6471.119618657715
 Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr1847.9728708891084
 Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance1337257924.6244454
  "I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her3078791616878060.0
"  Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in110.63592458143947
 She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr136.09131940664076
 Collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed108.22386097499566
 There was no help for it however194.50202639671872
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr1031.0686498779464
 Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could509.2517050961825
 She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more1844.6577276769046
--It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors3812296.064857481
 The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_313589530.25279695
 Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply1394.1979315809356
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him5104.457814195501
  If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once592747293.9474521
 No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy171.19951016093012
 Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr603.474458732864
 Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia8052.6867997028185
     CHAPTER XVIII78.63614917689561
   Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr231.43610517356305
 Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her1598.8182966788538
 She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening1397785.7658817943
 But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr244.41433823658235
 Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr198428.9945431713
 Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,  "I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here147105040078.90475
"  This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make23387505.981355034
--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham260.827571289681
 She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr309642.66120238346
  But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice120421781012.21764
 The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification1952.2355967871342
 Mr7.688630579355423
 The moment of her release from him was ecstacy125.78248159711426
 When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr111683.7032081938
 Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him28245.220196857055
  "I dare say you will find him very agreeable1416.2992362464372
"  "Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me such an evil575.9881096146989
"  When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence108907968.18064956
 Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr16648.71638807724
 They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance41130684.177793175
 He replied, and was again silent1976.9814064475563
 After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with  "It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr62013.22739381669
 Darcy18.017419673323744
--_I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples4595433.095688855
"  He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said2852.6958221463615
  "Very well100.41688229480724
--That reply will do for the present213.9418717729441
--Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones129.77293317009082
"  "Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"  "Sometimes2668.93101810717
 One must speak a little, you know539.148548790583
"  "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"  "Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds3229993.479449178
--We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb55046.35256931107
"  "This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said he27687.97787120868
 "How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say4006.6998136768875
--_You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly877.7249804527194
"  He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton1940544.224567539
 She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance228069.00355202163
"  The effect was immediate93.19634804269172
 A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on578968.0553248657
 At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,  "Mr2242.7873006127647
 Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain1555.4375899359072
"  "He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life8414987.816058015
"  Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject791.2386484449218
 At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr224153.3676924077
 Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner400.9001697916672
  "I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir3847.2927445779897
 Such very superior dancing is not often seen119.65442831530136
 It is evident that you belong to the first circles264.6179603441071
 Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place830562606.4945514
 What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr112.66805758611905
--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me1591.7454366095812
"  The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together769130.7541780652
 Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,  "Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of99705.43834072897
"  "I do not think we were speaking at all445.14355709025995
--We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine7497.785946802181
"  "What think you of books?" said he, smiling1280.1024271626338
  "Books--Oh! no91.736659434884
--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings8359.285373498224
"  "I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject23677.965968279397
--We may compare our different opinions88.72157506596486
"  "No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else243.38117171541
"  "The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he, with a look of doubt43310.56905474738
  "Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr71811747.13540958
 You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created_6082.0881998940495
"  "I am," said he, with a firm voice13676.362610961976
  "And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"  "I hope not7114.583672431354
"  "It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first1714.8982246709863
"  "May I ask to what these questions tend?"  "Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity1030941.2836560762
 "I am trying to make it out429.61157721683355
"  "And what is your success?"  She shook her head1008.3101161787728
 "I do not get on at all332.3793064534962
 I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly174.2561685767526
"  "I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either72707493.30601509
"  "But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity8741.796647965846
"  "I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied4225.917890746443
 She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another9643856.670345873
  They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,  "So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr521052761777.429
 Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr8353.380771851958
 Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr885048.5856235871
 Darcy in a most infamous manner212.58750904642622
 I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr11259.707332158538
 Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way3039777747.5383563
 His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it331706.3571328746
 I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better1407.5625659455911
"  "His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr3052701.2870625197
 Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself93754.18892035552
"  "I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer8122.348630153546
 "Excuse my interference92.00521498049831
--It was kindly meant83.42221137576051
"  "Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself1488.1796835450427
--"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this1826.8820065461464
 I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr209.8994586317665
 Darcy18.017419673323744
" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley3406.0199358979166
--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness802271.0393495845
  "I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr1195287.2613464831
 Wickham32.508982098346834
 But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon21578.38899136811
"  "No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you4357685.55835033
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr11007.458636861556
 Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr19117.40732296022
 Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr99.12495215354784
 Wickham is by no means a respectable young man479.1099695590504
 I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr1684.5370173418962
 Darcy's regard79.9148691188053
"  "Mr25.892549922914036
 Bingley does not know Mr183.1299821484786
 Wickham himself?"  "No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton7483.594765206905
"  "This account then is what he has received from Mr282.41914363279113
 Darcy18.017419673323744
 But what does he say of the living?"  "He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr125813.12342058298
 Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only15198.195986084345
"  "I have not a doubt of Mr520.2416475866141
 Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only26392.548220851997
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before4120242.564497715
"  She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment2252.1318726639242
 Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it13074.039293057462
 On their being joined by Mr146.90444279474664
 Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr1062.96069506176
 Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery58267.09090439887
  "I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness813353.5679278127
 I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine203060.25054332888
 How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before8924158.909075629
 My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology106.91713542297273
"  "You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr480.1004838708371
 Darcy?"  "Indeed I am2026.976773798287
 I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_467.0017589345552
 It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night5233.680616506486
"  Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr521.400801120432
 Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr17463264.40458478
 Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance232.48208872045913
--Mr37.07530761059661
 Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,  "My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained383627067319.261
 You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty1862.482970149327
 Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself15413.614516502565
" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr335.40308261551337
 Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident1129.3289730527497
 Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh1850731170.5273058
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr1018.1284626406456
 Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility1035.5920916945843
 Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way31536.167562469946
 Collins then returned to Elizabeth105.47450247374724
  "I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception134712.58371683492
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention341.75024368450175
 He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily4327893.736345366
 It was really a very handsome thought385.10605930635467
 Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him3147.7999612640147
"  As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr9920.464314096722
 Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane6893.112435672819
 She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters32750.24039157227
 Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much17914.09778797435
 Bingley32.63584333211581
--It was an animating subject, and Mrs410.65717216128917
 Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match307.8004551143854
 His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do15070725223.02909
 It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked595760022.7388402
 It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs10525.707976063126
 Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life376.42825188676727
 She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it1111.3117259681233
  In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr359517.0733874152
 Darcy, who sat opposite to them177.9794122566979
 Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical101.92724102179129
  "What is Mr191.9101571839188
 Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear26011555.886089552
"  "For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower722.756270167814
 Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing336.57331136716414
"  Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence8404.857425389571
 Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone545.692891287432
 Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation98.94758374099744
 She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr271.2547288568202
 The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity245.46180963054138
  At length however Mrs80.96532293680782
 Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken78295.3699131187
 Elizabeth now began to revive100.11869349011963
 But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company103606.65741696351
 By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song138682.15484193945
 Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected7483.795939483743
--Elizabeth was in agonies88.50555149605647
 She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley8204.485426704457
 She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave111227.12061760583
 She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night890.2258112659925
 He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,  "That will do extremely well, child35065.01591930615
 You have delighted us long enough96.02003322005126
 Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit197.68278276744658
"  Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good158411.00023812315
--Others of the party were now applied to460.7373469848834
  "If I," said Mr791.4947576183611
--I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to13004.586823939066
 The rector of a parish has much to do152.69550619603442
--In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron14306.54078979617
 He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible1372335.5323010841
 And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment97802.78518519073
" And with a bow to Mr267.4436314441283
 Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room3763.394839673293
--Many stared79.06296615354147
--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr347.1675006122166
 Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr123.72059266153528
 Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man24585.11872102415
  To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed31248556159.064373
 That his two sisters and Mr196.80408290726515
  The rest of the evening brought her little amusement392.04519359059896
 Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others2682776.05567731
 In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room5527.928672570169
 He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening53254810.486928396
 Collins's conversation to herself84.39676888517772
  She was at least free from the offence of Mr288.9464454418574
 Darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak2014.6791435762545
 She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr1509.1339248808845
 Wickham, and rejoiced in it201.68956354250093
 Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family46910.66619958323
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 They repulsed every attempt of Mrs90.72443921257232
 Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr141327.3652246653
 Collins, who was complimenting Mr325.5421682455372
 Darcy said nothing at all110.29661671538575
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene114.11646997976024
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other1696.5431421377587
 Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs96.84007395836933
 Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn16574.631172019337
  When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs463.5859614435849
 Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr1225.6498352428544
 Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation11181.219436510224
 Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time2533182.711010706
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four months327651.53399642993
 Of having another daughter married to Mr143.6827338429981
 Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure4031.5888270321066
 Bingley and Netherfield83.5867551367892
     CHAPTER XIX52.675062424389665
   The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn330.0503791937684
 Collins made his declaration in form92.84382676484228
 Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business33344663.529095326
 On finding Mrs85.12560744656449
 Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,  "May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"  Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs269657316668.77252
 Bennet instantly answered,  "Oh dear!--Yes--certainly510.65521263068644
" And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,  "Dear Ma'am, do not go56360.700354828674
--I beg you will not go618.539369532953
--Mr37.07530761059661
--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear3441.2291339320423
 I am going away myself137.55199236348884
"  "No, no, nonsense, Lizzy187.7428663304547
--I desire you will stay where you are256.0951768754999
"--And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr25741.423512746976
 Collins32.5170408942687
"  Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion1333592.4964641414
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr7437.503974886379
 Collins began81.22388549102862
  "Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections94611.39652320027
 You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken761.9691237299586
 Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life3624.07262048278
 But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did1458191.8112468482
"  The idea of Mr227.64859818212602
 Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:  "My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish233697718.56818396
 Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness14443053.875295905
 Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs53711.316039194644
 Collins, you must marry265.7888771207689
 A clergyman like you must marry101.65635709668
--Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way16825.898034508158
 This is my advice88.59458572536052
 Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her50592.877236578104
' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer32139301.0788514
 You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite24788.243379324555
 Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women37808.672257261685
 But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years665130180018.9154
 This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem48104.88608767158
 And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection1830.7244523241204
 which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to3176.632453009416
 On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married165387.46021185777
"  It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now202.7685601389562
  "You are too hasty, Sir," she cried4104.5966529897305
 "You forget that I have made no answer767.6355454534889
 Let me do it without farther loss of time226.67422419034872
 Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me143.81996634715748
 I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them128764.90482497582
"  "I am not now to learn," replied Mr1884.1105450930263
 Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time12734267.00524977
 I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long20301.78553126331
"  "Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration37079.16273867873
 I am perfectly serious in my refusal141.97549296492318
--You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so68218354.318652
--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation19377.82891285952
"  "Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr2074.57736716762
 Collins very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you414.7209215621995
 And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications231571.532650233
"  "Indeed, Mr88.11875011740673
 Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary120.41338179980976
 I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise12699.95888113541
 In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach396592.5175862144
 This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled1122.1809236820552
" And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr14327.331470516412
 Collins thus addressed her,  "When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character14099616186.144974
"  "Really, Mr90.95859360256571
 Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly3742.666470754958
 If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one341737.12972631986
"  "You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course25067.043284034302
 My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable6033.584251789713
 My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you110756843.2397384
 Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications771.7883026760694
 As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females271457.6216000328
"  "I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man247547.46230046076
 My feelings in every respect forbid it230.1654810464332
 Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart4618.975860261016
"  "You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable632160.5615428541
"  To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female17436450.2165427
     CHAPTER XX79.28044708716925
   Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs207.41738389350843
 Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection186147.09042447843
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character5948157.18432222
  This information, however, startled Mrs1163.0448825235924
  "But depend upon it, Mr168.48684622490725
 Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be brought to reason3948.735202949912
 I will speak to her about it myself directly173.90208070001972
 Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state442709.1260380084
 If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity26050.775063386234
 Bennet, alarmed82.47776582664133
 "Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these161.91841224223785
 I will go directly to Mr132.04525893845465
 Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure7778.918684558617
"  She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,  "Oh! Mr953058.9962095484
 Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar767.2697576597577
 You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr103.85099977295944
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication16855.970408995658
  "I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech150087.223453456
 "Of what are you talking?"  "Of Mr4123.34393904502
 Collins and Lizzy79.30610607617368
 Lizzy declares she will not have Mr217.15981687747586
 Collins, and Mr76.68019657990487
 Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy2943.451858808961
"  "And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business211.47123199878104
"  "Speak to Lizzy about it yourself116.66898236674515
 Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him125.18087036240466
"  "Let her be called down137.11655350349784
"  Mrs21.43911708981833
 Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library2739.9913810247654
  "Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared1662.7564701714828
 "I have sent for you on an affair of importance221.90086544460408
 I understand that Mr95.42388581988597
 Collins has made you an offer of marriage211.65947326823408
 Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was1417.871594555253
 "Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"  "I have, Sir24370.647669238788
"  "Very well110.44257845040752
 We now come to the point297.123252353798
 Your mother insists upon your accepting it89.40518342829942
 Is not it so, Mrs151.90852284853747
 Bennet?"  "Yes, or I will never see her again7172.63676263462
 From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents6680.129465625428
--Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr2134.953744472972
 Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_3188.599438442601
"  Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs6383.063553386961
 Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed3528.6444382847226
  "What do you mean, Mr294.90646939756664
 Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him919.0433589280256
"  "My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request168790.89894226717
 First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room7547.790992195492
 I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be28485.789379269245
"  Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs27032.955609361747
 Bennet give up the point174.89062622912394
 She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns562.8503742381807
 She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks648.8261135578216
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed410.69131185426016
 He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way12332.182876874815
 His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret7760.438301332786
  While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them679.3050820969046
 She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr4380727.114643743
 Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him4549.879053566105
"  Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs240801.84722315834
 Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family79184.13508392
"  Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth659.5315712887946
  "Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs272.9760372196742
 Bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way4047.660612392375
--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead25304022.53018389
--_I_ shall not be able to keep you--and so I warn you3394.0289172751727
--I have done with you from this very day196.7948820721043
--I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word5442394.186955824
 I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children923.0925475979878
--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body1836.064043999912
 Nobody can tell what I suffer!--But it is always so145.659725208271
 Those who do not complain are never pitied152.19570295163703
 She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr11644.27838452365
 Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,  "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr69988463.3962976
 Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear25500.989376050115
 Bennet thus began the projected conversation99.0102250480635
--"Oh! Mr425.30059015100306
 Collins!"--  "My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point2493143.0233633933
 Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter47638.949889406606
 Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned7055212.030125418
 Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation37666.92304360598
 Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf221.27263503877566
 But we are all liable to error166.2769133872887
 I have certainly meant well through the whole affair276.08389495021254
 My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise83264.63527720113
"     CHAPTER XXI77.61819378610153
   The discussion of Mr115.40833868712862
 As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence6249.641596990022
 He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend49182988697.59799
 Bennet's ill humour or ill health88.69645943003054
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins was also in the same state of angry pride328.41034193434086
 Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it7345.264416104376
 He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay4497.824274153659
  After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr405.7399383742405
 Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball1526.3137270287955
 He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over47818.94673035136
--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed59933.219387291116
  "I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr157953.5507722245
 Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself4986557.021781137
"  She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her10904114.937859122
 His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother141094.90165849647
  Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately20313.663508638463
 The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages145709.22526196076
 Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs5577162.564911619
 The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again60696.35141839704
 You shall hear what she says102.60088378621933
"  She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr4514.399189311088
 Hurst had a house98.20604090855169
 The next was in these words195.61877919568408
 "I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence1640041.263769923
 I depend on you for that117.67051098575702
" To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr5163033.279669199
 Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his4269484.072549802
 But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--Mr24467.383829876217
 Bingley will not be detained in London by them470.06740845844604
 I will read it to you--  "When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel197953971959.70966
 I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you30122.57477151695
"  "It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter62995.05140053595
"  "It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_1794.1159954185714
"  "Why will you think so? It must be his own doing2052.269373632975

 But you do not know _all_1689.0176203868507
 I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me279.0907389217516
 I will have no reserves from _you_841.6746103199862
" "Mr25.892549922914036
 Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again59785.57180964329
 I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister223302.56450986795
--Will you hear it?"  "Most willingly1843.3121985010753
"  "You shall have it in few words133.5751567752571
 Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy16255.723646176339
 She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you6814.17860387005
"  Jane shook her head97.30676187000213
  "Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me1991.0700939128778
--No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection187.64254526684164
 Miss Bingley I am sure cannot671.63656768794
 She is not such a simpleton389.9069276233656
 Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes1575.9655625351988
 But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend233467135388.75186
"  "If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy127500.66714322621
 But I know the foundation is unjust213.20969512354645
 Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself71555.55086310665
"  "That is right124.34341738507415
 Believe her to be deceived by all means512.3383320055322
 You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer2557.9121232124644
"  "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"  "You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him133044665855.97984
"  "How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate9864.855651400983
"  "I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion9527.371852833212
"  "But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required418.2605766058673
 A thousand things may arise in six months!"  The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt4260.757246535075
 It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one699350.796460354
  She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect109743.00392821182
 Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart246716.0450437624
  They agreed that Mrs86.29327987870867
 Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together366471590.14648795
 After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr1519.1711269112914
 Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses13784586.07871512
     CHAPTER XXII79.28044708716925
   The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr115553.03544453938
 Collins32.5170408942687
 Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her201.13425640963166
 "It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express400537.4153720314
 This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr995.9407291472755
 Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself94.51094734696902
 Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon144903.3504034384
 But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet123065.38152993216
 He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday424715515.20001525
 His reception however was of the most flattering kind308.7029279055707
 Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane30822.57088116844
 But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there273.2841699203648
 Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness874222839.9994612
 The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained26437.738882390404
  Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity3757.1304806711723
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr470.9496892171693
 Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr428.99389187237125
 Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St42825.90097050705
 James's52.58284539574353
 The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion426.9361473431535
 The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid15875.71798506871
 Charlotte herself was tolerably composed87.49367664680827
 She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it1393.8294165345312
 Her reflections were in general satisfactory107.51252264787703
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary6279.676066305483
 But still he would be her husband242.6854153252455
--Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want118349.77037349933
 This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it12859.528423287216
 Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation174589.41914522645
 She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr2809.0589922861836
 Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family8646.319525565328
 A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love53206223.716798596
 Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them2870.512896856423
  "My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible218661615.22398388
"  They were all astonished; and Mr320.09749804200493
 Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,  "But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness663057.5381336431
"  "My dear sir," replied Mr1639.1745873242826
 Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence249843.69744927462
"  "You cannot be too much on your guard650.4592565412386
 Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence19470050.864488073
 As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth515000.8988464518
"  With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return954.2312042110505
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him302973.65024535335
 But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away1097.5010975437212
 Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before21029.329629003325
  The possibility of Mr159.72078609965533
 Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,  "Engaged to Mr4031047457.725499
 Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"  The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,  "Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible that Mr231895058.71089965
  "I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr13825.925581781801
 Collins was wishing to marry you91.81119060479655
 But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done780204.5783269763
 I am not romantic you know158.32161560609003
 I never was82.94762463064164
 I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr256.76364201426713
 Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state58673.86272011934
"  Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family2616.1427108433145
 Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard6550.019652316576
 It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match2029.2455540301153
 The strangeness of Mr79.35640472074572
 She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage546030.7705839635
 Charlotte the wife of Mr90.95784397351265
 Collins, was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen33813.78964717306
     CHAPTER XXIII79.28044708716925
   Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family479933.13255212223
 With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs7147.548461684227
 Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,  "Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know that Mr216837.28756998928
 Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"  Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy11274909.612370491
  Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr4018611090.0994797
 Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London665.2385010737958
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent11936.36395741636
 In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr78484.6779416375
 Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off20701.815999911374
 Nothing could console and nothing appease her91.62363352036107
--Nor did that day wear out her resentment115.36428806680046
 A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter86738.61797989228
 Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!  Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable1273907522559.8818
 Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr647.1112863184192
 Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton1725.0002701969515
  Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs1083.5983986585045
 Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away471.20193478374625
  Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again128877.5974746884
 Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return2535754.076670954
  Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again7749.356242719848
 The promised letter of thanks from Mr125.33932865471567
 After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men4018751274091608.5
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs894.0505441695119
 Bennet25.669748167391045
 On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband1756.331050171857
--It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome19181.676920966445
--She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable571.4130531387308
 Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs87.128658721687
 Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr953.7211551042857
 Bingley's continued absence79.76233576705465
  Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject334.80057468727847
 Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs5036.341575086742
 Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood322.60613100034954
  Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away645.3461127545529
 Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring184765.45339241522
 The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment1404073.2562472674
  As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to937950.9359431093
 But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used45346218.19321499
 It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity113.59171354166611
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction11404.104412267856
 He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company76628.00507687953
 The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed170786.79005339113
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet was really in a most pitiable state165.0419706837577
 The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of4286.088461642218
 The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her282.7076690646937
 As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence157.5941086779069
 Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr7236.270000498367
 Bennet were dead86.14080538305674
 She complained bitterly of all this to her husband622.539470075735
  "Indeed, Mr86.33625820244218
 Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"  "My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts126380510754.54791
 Let us hope for better things89.77142169509507
 Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor1615.5858665741655
"  This was not very consoling to Mrs353.041753518644
 Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before,  "I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate22426053.277671546
 If it was not for the entail I should not mind it6237.859677940309
"  "What should not you mind?"  "I should not mind any thing at all8610.672244314292
"  "Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility1447.8900730135222
"  "I never can be thankful, Mr214.57539199361082
 Bennet, for any thing about the entail301.30282347554925
 How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr4767.506864899748

     CHAPTER I42.30409824657876
   Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt299.7056697446382
 The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country51641.60930576228
  Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort2404567.001930466
 Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter4390.132440237901
 She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr296.42957769456115
 Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture3328.0163735432016
 Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others5528.01292244957
 To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit499.13001999122935
 It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing5372.158166997398
 She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded21725411.894495897
  A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs15760.018620583036
 Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,  "Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him16955126.154632557
 But I will not repine223.29243952872648
 It cannot last long85.63352475894976
 He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before1640.2765041437503
"  Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing631.4370288380036
  "You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason16655.101571535866
 He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all10479.470444176904
 I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with594.8748240219961
--I shall certainly try to get the better358.8753878514657
"  With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself46743161.039305925
 Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you6984.853564982146
 I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve674.853542104583
"  Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection230.9529512796971
  "Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair47072.95219595991
 _You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body5972.875126087206
 _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it8573.25684300592
 Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will1055.3261675288227
 You need not141.3580184470368
 There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well1415.1762449549176
 The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense2643674.376621905
 I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage1456.5682303719616
 It is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!"  "My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these71139.16179773844
 You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper421.2984834994844
 Consider Mr80.01135198737033
 Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character99.48112356259396
 My dear Jane, Mr142.4055659069537
 You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas1131.5090631072408
 You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness17387.28395560329
"  "I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together23675938.6538233
 You alluded to something else90.64801437989772
 You mentioned _two_ instances151.88629407290733
 We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured658.5773991725766
 We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect1124.5955581363169
 It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us286.2822052531326
 Women fancy admiration means more than it does123.57252553489019
"  "And men take care that they should253.75230388718123
"  "If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine119772.69072360809
"  "I am far from attributing any part of Mr395.26617999848895
 Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery650509.3949233198
 Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business869.0002466442244
 But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem2566.0982142151656
"  "You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him340.50374983904004
"  "I cannot believe it191.7407979934092
 They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride23678.69357050533
"  "Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing1545078.777881055
 They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better583.2473832606943
 But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's5430.971890744874
 What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed453691.78896248917
 By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy334.1985811549044
 Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood14218.09050711921
"  Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr1015.8683817758244
 Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them202.04692722857064
 Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity130767.76384719645
 Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day62184210.76971478
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet's best comfort was, that Mr169.5943503321823
 Bingley must be down again in the summer162.12610829565355
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Bennet treated the matter differently98.01533820425642
 "So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find161977.29456437644
 Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then565.7551355818249
 When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane862.9481344583471
 Now is your time95.71928217219686
 Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country541.2772383185456
 Let Wickham be _your_ man413.81884192856904
 He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably1329.9579446393182
"  "Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me714.7475173416148
 We must not all expect Jane's good fortune113.43900070166656
"  "True," said Mr442.7398207834162
 Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it269164.49329882185
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family1944.76716599945
 They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve2434.141268746921
 The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr559.3597963759719
 Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr2618990.9389619078
 Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter432.1137649937744
  Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else Mr38578.833876061304
     CHAPTER II52.66659867208486
   After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr193.16204842441218
 The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men18702875.750940442
 He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks22208.02661978731
  On the following Monday, Mrs126.85483342843871
 Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn31205.97713701861
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs296.221929859988
 Bennet and Mrs75.16516588186175
 Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces2269.436881788271
 Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard389.9868003550253
 They had frequently been staying with her in town215.34721381621273
  The first part of Mrs87.62884639034075
 When this was done, she had a less active part to play1966.96794869561
 It became her turn to listen119.85077358107127
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister189.00706060901265
 Bingley, if she could308.52727297307683
 But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr126162.5761492813
 Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness3041.684255257625
 I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is2326.7734986588066
 It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else67263.84132924261
 However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves192930.11545852275
"  Mrs21.43911708981833
 Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation25074263.33131631
  When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject397.1358399041446
 "It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she32459.028949983174
 Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent415618.72942818364
"  "An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not do for _us_151548.65308248944
 We do not suffer by _accident_140.14638134735202
 It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before944576.511206778
"  "But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea3717.794324204727
 It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment1212.835290518767
 Pray, how _violent was_ Mr112.8964143807801
 Bingley's love?"  "I never saw a more promising inclination6402.91224211728
 Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable1799.7405478946505
 At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer175085.37348543128
 Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"  "Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt48580.23087386614
 Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately27452.45062548026
 It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner11029.698605551064
"  Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence668.6325287114984
  "I hope," added Mrs1244.3457070755596
 Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her1900.9035149884496
"  "And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr25942.257526867677
 Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr250599.2600120144
"  "So much the better100.8495988474052
 But does not Jane correspond with the sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling9037.703737943735
"  "She will drop the acquaintance entirely132.71477582143734
"  But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless131832222.70641959
 It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions84931.50760830387
  The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement1379184.4969549715
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner28949.771761543347
 Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs938.2385413126995
 Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both663.6316276156813
 Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment2381849982.1515245
  To Mrs77.46895352112455
 Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers158.4396949586994
 About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he belonged47501.5853832252
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr167.00990497291167
 Darcy by character perfectly well94.25140154310371
 Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse106.69171657137552
 In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself91793.81732974625
 On being made acquainted with the present Mr214.4586484670979
 Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr3490436.2010003896
 Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy217.0026531522819
   Mrs9.62941339842944
 Seriously, I would have you be on your guard579.685289692206
 I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better226945650.71409672
 But as it is--you must not let your fancy run away with you365.1567048559235
 You have sense, and we all expect you to use it723.8628628611742
 Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure3515.6621343793363
 You must not disappoint your father202.64307090939275
"  "My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed816.6548914308704
"  "Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise1665.132030375741
"  "Well, then, you need not be under any alarm1537.1023053019026
 I will take care of myself, and of Mr1540.7078441424094
 Wickham too84.88289842916723
 He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it64715.09024700223
"  "Elizabeth, you are not serious now2549.7342287810693
"  "I beg your pardon104.52776449185899
 I will try again114.81657042295443
 Wickham; no, I certainly am not329.60212865401076
 But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be better that he should not12272.10381381086
 I see the imprudence of it202.21358194239625
 Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it9906.377063857308
 My father, however, is partial to Mr2362.24243150619
 Wickham32.508982098346834
 In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry78026653602242.64
 I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object3833.875202054267
 When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing113267.89607524652
 In short, I will do my best617.1641308640372
"  "Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often6803.390467267835
 At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him412.5496855364285
"  "As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_13867624.299223822
 But do not imagine that he is always here so often1062.260505859205
 It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week880.3727237653304
 You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends1842.3605257061251
 But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied193876.26950994998
"  Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented1072911.999672889
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs23228.007770686636
 Bennet25.669748167391045
 His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she "_wished_ they might be happy329983.95646108466
" Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room14145659.665441979
 As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,  "I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza13454.630585195864
"  "_That_ you certainly shall420.37931903894554
"  "And I have another favour to ask721.4805162030411
"  "I am not likely to leave Kent for some time2062.7396043443696
"  Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit1202.3195899039274
"  The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual104385.43968997855
 Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible16873.295979905484
 Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was40597215.06763209
 Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen274428832.29991406
 She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise1803.179155034605
 The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging9653.6227658435
 It was Mr80.1209097228164
 Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest12647.046791018623
  Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys6206322.321358795
 Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline1681.7579329256675
 She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been lost29600.948901958556
  "My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street5085385.177533543
"  She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley7997.866010026802
 "I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London10745464.564445237
 I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her149.1113379252907
 He was well, but so much engaged with Mr1008.6112617235992
 Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him395.06112201156
 I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner472.18349533266337
 My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs239.7338546238132
 Hurst were going out88.69009926216124
 I dare say I shall soon see them here459.7095071965082
 It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr279.6711690033701
 Bingley her sister's being in town151.72998286879314
  Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him798.9863756709201
 She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention79866.97492255107
 After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer180471.63176999363
       "My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in      her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have      been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me345760.4531247458
 But, my      dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me      obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour      was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion212750.08506724943
 Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;      and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time889.3635133417677
 When      she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;      she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said      not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so      altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly      resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer48213207765.02291
 I pity, though I      cannot help blaming her416.61514571982894
 She was very wrong in singling me out as      she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on      her side6972.10130758743
 But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been      acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her      brother is the cause of it68572.22323431225
 He knows of my      being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and      yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to      persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy64285496.507943735
 I cannot      understand it114.6932378384121
 If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should      be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of      duplicity in all this748984.0744474342
 But I will endeavour to banish every painful      thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,      and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt140036.85481429464
 Miss Bingley said something of his never      returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not      with any certainty14781.030081450097
 We had better not mention it147.16760544478348
 I am extremely      glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at      Hunsford497.9734032646354
 Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria1050.875471736796
       "Your's, &c79.92630845979468
 All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over168.39955157181288
 She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions712.0216855612273
 His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr1614813.9161948238
 Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away3462.061147892586
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself18828.285849748143
 His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else3303.8248358529686
 Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it152550.39703126645
 The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence11373760.539554399
 Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy2363980.531597185
  All this was acknowledged to Mrs189.30542396054582
 Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil59058353.16699724
 But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King1128.6679289608999
 I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl1332155.5166584414
 There can be no love in all this259.528953816733
 Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly98.71485363441833
 Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do343.12305893834105
 They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain141098.5627585424
"     CHAPTER IV51.5031401151251
 March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford129.37566283467342
 She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty609332.900580932
 Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr744.425930620931
 Collins32.5170408942687
 Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch32274.670206331513
 She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter963.5251279345891
 The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be10322.916815315997
  The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter335079871.91408867
  The farewell between herself and Mr123.93844389624573
 Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more279.45259784963315
 His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing5070705701510.068
  Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable6928.378598336783
 Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise5112998.280771129
 Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long2005.0774388438967
 He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information632.2555305867132
  It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon15176.067107283683
 As they drove to Mr122.26854826878181
 Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever2038118.9668408013
 On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower969973.5522300664
 All was joy and kindness88.67239031700973
 The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres15561.196916493684
 Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection469085.8527444806
 It was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long34540.35459019365
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance11832.107142101562
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well155.51259945919932
  "But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary4591343.816804598
"  "Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary1166997347.7163408
"  "If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think73308.9176182815
"  "She is a very good kind of girl, I believe9869.829286615104
 I know no harm of her139.88660148858295
"  "But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune1209.778750813222
"  "A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe484.52290107140306
 If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?"  "_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_3842180.814152356
 It only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling119.41465471042476
"  "Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose7770.035650971208
 _He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish6144.653622848588
"  "No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose7708.902324612494
 I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire121775.83718853135
"  "Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better237285.14912275205
 I am sick of them all244.0877032183634
 Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all201.6264471918464
"  "Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment259.619356336187
"  Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer140353.8961853597
  "We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs2180.0683036288597
"  No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful58088.13637649422
 "My dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour75356.16775584943
 What are men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing292209.918310889
 We _will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen2323.232416709645
 Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation1807.229519879822
 Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers300.4187900975605
"     CHAPTER V76.9912565002754
   Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight257746473.40973514
  When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view12108.115404201693
 The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side281.38280790876627
 Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants7221.230558616997
  At length the Parsonage was discernible86.51794384972278
 The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving5315.982582187543
 Mr7.688630579355423
 In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other36424.62126194939
 Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received22900.194411077322
 She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family167792.72995799396
 They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment7973148.42711905
  Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him1942684369.4465358
 But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion517911.61196135136
 When Mr36.198926912249625
 Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte1134.762570925731
 Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear437.17932028433154
 After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London, Mr2506203.4300335404
 Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself74290.56578783739
 To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible58634.36148950661
 Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind1122.6689924794837
 He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump1700.6357332267173
 But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house837497.5434551527
 Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help5015901.954880205
 It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit3895.1183601488738
 When Mr36.198926912249625
 Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten76360.3062515939
  She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country779.3412053852712
 Collins joining in, observed,  "Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her56436534.36444663
 She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over43786.95418461906
 I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here1228.3218553199863
 Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming133.4944568954129
 We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home822.9867520392744
 Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us138.9468053768127
"  "Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour316550.9314155217
"  "Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say5757.083348808534
 She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference384.4801165217315
"  The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well25680971.488520566
 She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr243.44131301223447
 Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings622.0670398167817
 A lively imagination soon settled it all106.51279336203413
  About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her4468992.472703325
 She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,  "Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is3359480775.431839
 Make haste, and come down this moment305.10235132506534
 "I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!"  "La! my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine110481225.1753653
 The old lady is Mrs90.96660793250865
 Jenkinson, who lives with them136.84072015979277
 The other is Miss De Bourgh352.511770554098
 Only look at her111.31547445664494
 She is quite a little creature147.71058874040105
 Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"  "She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind430109.5784504101
 Why does she not come in?"  "Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does6677.3803014652685
 It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in1371.787294802895
"  "I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas2478.2071367238386
 "She looks sickly and cross90.96080486616745
--Yes, she will do for him very well705.3456648681283
 She will make him a very proper wife231.99891401952027
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way172446.51804008117
  At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house77986.9660833567
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day339540.9277797231
     CHAPTER VI52.53769296248504
   Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete312.15564776125524
  "I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings1326615.6706909651
 I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen1739.0466164264446
 About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon125.80796715173457
"  Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings13237.234675282454
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them130260.61492081474
  When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,  "Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel191297.90403527836
 Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter265.00459863561116
 I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more67710.15696002399
 Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed273.4379175392125
 She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved537.9308860274011
"  While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner18626.752055380246
--Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St164117310.08437347
 James's52.58284539574353
  As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park1485.0266995160005
 Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh369342.1904618159
--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her102.89803494884988
 She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation82045.26641419994
  From the entrance hall, of which Mr312.3927937352049
 Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs123530.92129101585
 Jenkinson were sitting84.79293773450917
--Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs20907.50422668813
 Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary224448.5826445508
  In spite of having been at St288.01912492970047
 James's, Sir William was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look444061661.30113
 Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly915.0144296909866
--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome1332.7823093078293
 Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank15220.923884917418
 She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr3877.6911910828167
 Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented30925.23746401705
  When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr714.9980880957098
 Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small55292.84151524746
 There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies151.30443518699502
 Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs97284.70410537897
 Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes65917.34110988397
  After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, Mr63047.509290416936
 Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer5263.069130101876
  The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr8320.850625094063
--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear6493214.104269347
 But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them4990.873421147016
 The party did not supply much conversation101.44853105791078
 Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time4012428.7590712416
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed1074.4908227318342
 Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire20737.591934498487
  When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted151521672.76061743
 She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry14846702.300816935
 Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others659.7269466982943
 In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs98.58777634419921
 Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs53471.177920159746
 Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl836.0686936511142
 She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly298520987.21483386
--Lady Catherine then observed,  "Your father's estate is entailed on Mr630.3431315400697
 Collins, I think150.3112407373872
 For your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line169110.59009143728
--Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?"  "A little27787.50568078092
 Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it some day123.34938871597042
--Do your sisters play and sing?"  "One of them does6451.539666642399
"  "Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned360.6331018875456
--Do you draw?"  "No, not at all3989.374292088439
"  "That is very strange144.8111484742312
 But I suppose you had no opportunity376.7930928287398
 Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters165.85110382442863
"  "Has your governess left you?"  "We never had any governess5283.091724733736
"  "No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing3137.6908761283935
 Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education348.87694301550783
  "Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess you must have been neglected2368.1132837574955
"  "Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means2927.516829104021
 We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary1993.5197826487367
 Those who chose to be idle, certainly might223.44147221022084
"  "Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one361503.0103982668
 I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it1443.2150152007139
 Four nieces of Mrs85.03482157111365
 'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure8732.610263525135
"  "All!--What, all five out at once? Very odd!--And you only the second147.5118922414188
--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your younger sisters must be very young?"  "Yes, my youngest is not sixteen21559.797624793202
 Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company861.633919629597
 But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early1889190.983696155
--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first2131.730652488325
"  "Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person30117.77523265127
--Pray, what is your age?"  "With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it1030849.149427008
"  Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence82659.7400800431
  "You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age10811.595715499863
"  "I am not one and twenty270.97142320857597
"  When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed6266.64732097806
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs170386.6407484413
 Jenkinson to make up her party139.35660129754038
 Their table was superlatively stupid81.58713281357659
 Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs623.1896248288668
 A great deal more passed at the other table997.0045576378478
 Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself270.6813603597103
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many567.84679302267
 Sir William did not say much152.9420709628612
  When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs5764.944825339216
 The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow1299.676754504729
 From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr4115.903235480492
 Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed1356.889196080774
 As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was505599398.877709
 But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr656.941737318035
 Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands1839.6615438833144
     CHAPTER VII52.53769296248504
   Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with161555.95379172277
 While Sir William was with them, Mr744.2352747967583
 Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road13154633185.72929
 The room in which the ladies sat was backwards302.94590288485966
 Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr2350656.067987117
 Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement13710.485146717192
 Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day153236.1658014535
 She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out177382.9427359841
 Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours13361218.127122683
 Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits283019.4936460351
 She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs1285870.6030327536
 Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family106.42226657541197
  Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr76456.18372318249
 Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty2204.77061597294
  The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first2627800.395557159
 Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach1806.5710350425095
 This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors23138125.68377683
 Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity153989132.33607665
  In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away405.223820382427
 Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr193.3871892700819
 Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself63903832601735.195
  His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr489.7363765244246
 Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence394179.7993544219
 On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects253.50074225213658
 Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr856123.4859195951
 Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him91.91540811321988
 Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,  "I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility1194933.8699813534
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me154.3818723392266
 Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman2648.831301819061
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs12338.667883387747
 Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word812.2943516371199
  Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs49314.38895957635
 Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body382.89438826601327
 At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family3418.0467259106767
 She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added,  "My eldest sister has been in town these three months199947.71872599275
 Have you never happened to see her there?"  She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet27703015916.25419
 The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away4862.905984558132
     CHAPTER VIII42.21969295599913
   Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings122007.62992659425
 It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening115671449493.15569
 For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter863.2834008318397
 Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr3036.604178068169
  The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room3615.033117202684
 Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room528363789.52827144
  Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs2084.1525428803716
 Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much104.12404412252779
 He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr3048812737.980796
 Darcy18.017419673323744
 _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out,  "What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is3113861373.2496815
  "Of music! Then pray speak aloud101.4292732616118
 It is of all subjects my delight165.78425184211466
 I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music3261.0432599123083
 There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste5805.108384634374
 If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient25782.355693519454
 I am confident that she would have performed delightfully906.3379598202488
 How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"  Mr282.16710821263706
 Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency174.0398555783683
"  "I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice258384.312016273
 She practises very constantly87.67090060672605
 It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account168655.61139986556
 I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice1453.6914374833555
 I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs27074.866308360535
 Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in Mrs315909.0226623055
 She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house30241.588396391147
  When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument136255.87325740512
 He drew a chair near her101.57770798277147
 Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance3198848.356728221
 Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well15893.107962400842
 There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others697.0734944833941
 My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me145.9460121121685
"  Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say7431117.298340401
 I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit526829.0929680981
 Indeed, Mr86.92087609538716
 Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear301423.60266275785
"  "I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly9297.403812212437
 "I should like to know how he behaves among strangers1184.7731784308287
 The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances! I am sorry to pain you--but so it was1690780.935325658
 He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner18198.930995184972
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy, you cannot deny the fact215.74069735972537
"  "I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party8624.549413154607
"  "True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room212.42209643979126
 Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders1228.2537885035854
"  "Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers4024631.0484080566
"  "Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam16540.866424363536
 "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"  "I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to him170336130.54934838
 It is because he will not give himself the trouble243.2432764255485
"  "I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before123012.55659716522
 I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done2115.675818825384
"  "My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do11367.229136025177
 They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression830.3311034316959
 It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution16582.231549370186
"  Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right3888.671399080985
 You have employed your time much better100.9671783581861
 No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting343.39204902318926
 We neither of us perform to strangers103.68938568431221
"  Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of10363.192933121938
 Elizabeth immediately began playing again84.25242554850372
 Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy,  "Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master168617643.8064696
 She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's1648.2702958401937
 Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn2483.9375027725796
"  Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation69735208978.91385
  Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste147.0163857415509
 Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home128027.47134929673
   Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs3462.6498568493257
 Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor20718.6797726527
 Darcy, and Mr91.44994985309535
 Darcy only, entered the room162.97547198152967
  He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within4397.003263724042
  They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence5019.122260870348
 It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,  "How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr2406607616.0162535
 Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before19451.450606825565
 He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London24009.065203037582
"  "Perfectly so--I thank you91.13802586786336
"  She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added,  "I think I have understood that Mr2154556.961505436
 Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"  "I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future4903762.757353859
 He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing4134.88882974004
"  "If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there392098.05354056385
 But perhaps Mr82.05332597018801
"  "I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers11964062.707836118
"  Elizabeth made no answer58.97142223741682
 She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him2675726.1012285072
  He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house2353.1695896421174
 Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr6412.651475917063
"  "I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object19028.403851759464
"  "Mr25.892549922914036
 Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife124.99828566307998
"  "Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had79519.2997324658
 My friend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr1715.8376235777152
 Collins as the wisest thing she ever did110.70331832966528
 She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her116381.23951909108
"  "It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends89956.841543711
"  "An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles422.6598965176021
"  "And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey554.416029194016
"  "I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match," cried Elizabeth45429.892073316776
 Collins was settled _near_ her family129.0797991428121
"  "It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire832.9027187854507
"  As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,  "I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family8372853016.683059
 The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances205.72573322982382
 Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil477.6279365925256
 Mr7.688630579355423
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance11794.431205373574
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment233472.79358640037
 _You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn449.09564652243495
"  Elizabeth looked surprised77.79831611204024
 The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,  "Are you pleased with Kent?"  A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk5301098627.624713
 The tête-à-tête surprised them85.25544185720624
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away333240.0499462103
  "What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone45339.71465109241
 "My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way89602.57206277725
"  But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year427032261.8254247
 All field sports were over87.85920293422656
 They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt3660.655375148131
 It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind476440690721.1052
  But why Mr87.2775145912938
 Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand3468.318347161195
 It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself864314.6606907938
 He seldom appeared really animated85.05224840116145
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Collins knew not what to make of him265.9470455517129
 Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out3722706382.3836336
--She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success3986.1518394578457
 He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable19323.08246114801
 It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind26814.133288778983
 Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power149573798.05432695
 He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr52015.9758851078
 Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all2021.7250290731733
     CHAPTER X42.21969295599913
   More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr836.0846511030818
 Darcy18.017419673323744
--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers387179.06561822345
--How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third2240.7026613905655
 It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her168493.67594161502
 He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr28070099.471911997
 Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too128379.57397590304
 His words seemed to imply it94.58628886175006
 Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter13813.759703443391
 It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage35709.947372934555
  She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr81530.67880842005
 Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her815.3350705449426
 Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,  "I did not know before that you ever walked this way101098.09816212277
"  And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together1553.4276432222534
  "Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she1314.0685076384195
  "Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again216.61125314767312
 He arranges the business just as he pleases156.0981170990385
"  "And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice17560.855520888035
 I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr2286.999280026208
"  "He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam7870.078573107431
 "But so we all do138.85850476732554
 A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence2053.101953366506
"  "In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either1129.402844589598
 Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"  "These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature575408.0827173216
 Younger sons cannot marry where they like142.53218599911284
"  "Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do1820.4181002007206
"  "Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money3170.1660638741123
"  "Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds807352017.1710591
 To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,  "I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal212389.35163467724
 But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her51107.08857523406
"  "No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me164583.38234629028
 I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy1420.9419593477317
"  "Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way170133.617721082
"  As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth12856630.091766866
 She directly replied,  "You need not be frightened6351.314005735597
 I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world443915.8867115695
"  "I know them a little190.6265685916766
 Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of Darcy's647.990560762687
"  "Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr3338.479847157745
 Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr89.09684154141256
 From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him6119.846191163767
 But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant108445.05625562122
 It was all conjecture178.6384105604103
"  "What is it you mean?"  "It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing13885033.228807854
"  "You may depend upon my not mentioning it193.39763851730052
"  "And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley8181.772516901545
 What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer1275470919.9410563
"  "Did Mr79.48968549050805
"  "And what arts did he use to separate them?"  "He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling1022303.000499147
 "He only told me, what I have now told you2131.7529981074317
"  Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation753.0912473975934
  "I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she14681.700493117087
 "Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings110.12848133860754
 Why was he to be the judge?"  "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"  "I do not see what right Mr1946874.0526028683
 Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy158935.33517706534
" "But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him288562.0577698082
"  "That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly164937.58492268724
"  This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr1077.42085331295
 Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage1412861.7118320672
 There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard1734695.6870859694
 It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected700.9150596555131
 That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr2388.405012459647
 Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them103440.5623079674
 If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer1650815.456092882
 He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted25230.282097415617
  "There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London3955.3454669800376
 All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating3008.490959620182
 Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr5775.183110619787
 Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach159.49793169252476
" When she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr165010.11588979262
 Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr152792131.8395313
 Bingley for his sister149.47783946949104
  The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr2362.411050366456
 Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea1891.6189782043975
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr197083.86999270442
 Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home688.0675204913362
     CHAPTER XI52.675062424389665
   When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr37085.32773146484
 Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent2530.987093007139
 They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering741.1202281480475
 But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded53822726.631188035
 Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal2929.9738035357673
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings17438.590161666318
 It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do11664195.871286953
  She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him196457691.53559732
  While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her59011730.92603758
 But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr21752.069023712316
 Darcy walk into the room107.00085179281015
 In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better1939.1748837255525
 She answered him with cold civility121.61807687583043
 He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room6830.968725927479
 Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word389.0227232559245
 After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began,  "In vain have I struggled4633.212847286912
 It will not do342.750938350397
 My feelings will not be repressed402.19210204657344
 You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you977.9789816074269
"  Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression130.55462554558042
 She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent619.6583607481621
 This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed153352.8516892293
 He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride465809.78821066266
 His sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit5467.467113777268
  In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger731476054.0729507
 She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done17135.33609802951
 He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand17340883.43179989
 As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer33294.10275858284
 Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,  "In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned1081567056.5466287
 It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you12213.6591343422
 But I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly1910.2224810151474
 It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration56708.95410039854
 Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise7942.399386132175
 His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature2263.9570945681735
 He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it9264.244206790727
 At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,  "And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected2952006901.094733
 But it is of small importance563.0300217342531
"  "I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have other provocations106414273.45649172
 You know I have97.30070501655705
 Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"  As she pronounced these words, Mr219200885.61643425
 Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued4991.638275013315
  "I have every reason in the world to think ill of you3014.9796564267954
 No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_207.98104346780457
 You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind16816176.89261243
"  She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse8241.204577887407
  "Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated6587.763352734578
  With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success4793321.978597642
 Towards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself1850.0388811041787
"  Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her3992.4062496490496
  "But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded11649.673057180355
 Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided605.6629481046807
 Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr178.68720706047938
 Wickham32.508982098346834
 On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"  "You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour166428170.31661984
  "Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"  "His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed399820.1821452642
"  "And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy1319.1495877925227
 "You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty219.8504444506281
 You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him2104.617307906515
 You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule868.4105374825128
"  "And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully25049513.019128624
 My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design1174754.636718787
 These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing18819.81462253896
 But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence107.4884481042025
 Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related186.5182563431686
 They were natural and just88.44418245708984
 Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections? To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"  Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,  "You are mistaken, Mr19805196.73276878
 Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner84132.23928457421
"  She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,  "You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it34312583.28271015
"  Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification8563.8685321984
 She went on131.80652096721332
  "From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry691957770426.421
"  "You have said quite enough, madam150.88036510691052
 Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness3718.671776879228
  The tumult of her mind was now painfully great561.737604799441
 She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour7036.616394970009
 Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it3517.279702753707
 That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr649.2956731911809
 Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection85077745183.0493
 But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr48594906.8925534
 Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited11147.674752797897
  She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room9287.879835270722
     CHAPTER XII42.21969295599913
   Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes1253.7333974781195
 She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise2307381.7688690326
 She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr1432.7036373784795
 Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road25972.23325423691
 The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground49899.689616017306
  After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park1076908.692843015
 The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees158429.34897018378
 She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr349634.89715371316
 Darcy, she was directly retreating560.5480561556615
 She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr11956.695767364465
 Darcy, she moved again towards the gate109.84831060616474
 He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you2826316.1668217513
 Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight140709.43134725958
  With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand541828.9870216387
--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it451.92938383203614
 It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--       "Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,      or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to      you43389992.81861499
 I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling      myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,      cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,      and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been      spared, had not my character required it to be written and read9939168065.34714
       "Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal      magnitude, you last night laid to my charge13184.274350002068
 The first mentioned      was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached      Mr3387.284636874819
      Wickham32.508982098346834
--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of      my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who      had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who      had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,      to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could      be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison165022051.3813049
--But      from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally      bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in      future secured, when the following account of my actions and their      motives has been read187198.41072470145
--If, in the explanation of them which is      due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which      may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry9843334.89668526
--The      necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd112.43626330697201
--I      had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with      others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other      young woman in the country831989.7823748823
--But it was not till the evening of the      dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a      serious attachment22113.114467563748
--At that      ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made      acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that      Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general      expectation of their marriage257933.5627361128
 From that moment I      observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then      perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had      ever witnessed in him26568.353630991678
 Your sister I also watched126.56420132082938
--Her look and      manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any      symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the      evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with      pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of      sentiment586494.5004066257
--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have      been in an error79885.90506190713
 Your superior knowledge of your sister must make      the latter probable225.93076950066674
--If it be so, if I have been misled by such      error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been      unreasonable61780.71937278721
 But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity      of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given      the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her      temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched2745736.876271534
--That I was      desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will      venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually      influenced by my hopes or fears997.5389449176139
--I did not believe her to be      indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial      conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason7711.279404994013
--My objections to      the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged      to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my      own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to      my friend as to me406447.12232045317
--But there were other causes of      repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to      an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to      forget, because they were not immediately before me49051.32474390323
--These causes      must be stated, though briefly111.13242872175451
--Pardon me87.36143190111926
--It pains me to offend you92.19817000012657
 But amidst      your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your      displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you      consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to      avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally      bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to      the sense and disposition of both1927251.569962453
--I will only say farther, that      from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was      confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me      before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy      connection84550.11532103068
--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon      returning610401.7657222212
--The part which I acted, is now to be explained299.73148152957566
--His      sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our      coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible      that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly      resolved on joining him directly in London44567.62866891591
--We accordingly      went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to      my friend, the certain evils of such a choice3449.3140501967428
--I described, and      enforced them earnestly89.80729059068864
--But Bingley has      great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment      than on his own2186.3723149184466
--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived      himself, was no very difficult point24931.54348148938
--I cannot blame myself for      having done thus much111.34157290667483
 There is but one part of my conduct in the      whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is      that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to      conceal from him your sister's being in town1009204.6618028493
 I knew it myself, as      it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant      of it22977.875072242918
--That they might have met without ill consequence, is      perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough      extinguished for him to see her without some danger6916.804185278977
--Perhaps this      concealment, this disguise, was beneath me117.30609942931602
--It is done, however,      and it was done for the best9956.912130159759
--On this subject I have nothing more      to say, no other apology to offer13456.324259050085
 If I have wounded your sister's      feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which      governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have      not yet learnt to condemn them1165793.1698555853
--With respect to that other, more      weighty accusation, of having injured Mr332.8813005743231
 Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but      of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one      witness of undoubted veracity95284.95167956651
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Wickham is the son of a very      respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the      Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his      trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on      George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore      liberally bestowed3357433589.8968973
 My father supported him at school, and      afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own      father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have      been unable to give him a gentleman's education488020.87275594677
 My father was not      only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always      engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the      church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it678834.9127155002
      As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think      of him in a very different manner109462.2476565611
 The vicious propensities--the      want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge      of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man      of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of      seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr2465321.793238293
      Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell279.92352604636045
      But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr286.6916468512063
 Wickham has created, a      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his      real character308.6595460764021
 It adds even another motive87.71904405605314
 My excellent father      died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr612.8325042307347
 Wickham was to      the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it      to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his      profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a      valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became      vacant7218294.331028915
 He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,      and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would      be a very insufficient support therein125355.86785835502
 I rather wished, than      believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to      accede to his proposal5726.7601185309695
 I knew that Mr133.17594603458735
 Wickham ought not to be a      clergyman1716.3144873517717
 The business was therefore soon settled97.25014101368998
 He resigned all      claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could      ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three      thousand pounds117869.30805671075
 All connection between us seemed now dissolved95.15426047594255
 I      thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his      society in town3398.406373482357
 For      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the      incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied      to me again by letter for the presentation426387.2626371096
 His circumstances, he      assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were      exceedingly bad16461.61768320372
 He had found the law a most unprofitable study,      and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would      present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there      could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other      person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered      father's intentions17834488373.705963
 You will hardly blame me for refusing to      comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it630.9038083947339
      His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his      circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me      to others, as in his reproaches to myself821.6993033723263
 After this period, every      appearance of acquaintance was dropt124.78560854652602
 How he lived I know not261.22930974349435
 But      last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice130.98746270057964
 I      must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget      myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce      me to unfold to any human being3874.5276092629965
 My sister, who is more than ten years my      junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel      Fitzwilliam, and myself28263.11478492477
 About a year ago, she was taken from      school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last      summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;      and thither also went Mr147024.62840515695
 Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there      proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs1840.8382636885165
      Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by      her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,      whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his      kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe      herself in love, and to consent to an elopement7945190.783323907
 I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the      intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea      of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as      a father, acknowledged the whole to me99831.87842565333
 You may imagine what I felt      and how I acted291.7320127687984
 Regard for my sister's credit and feelings      prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr728.9121231982464
 Wickham, who left      the place immediately, and Mrs329.1090442467183
 Younge was of course removed from      her charge320.3974718084466
 Mr7.688630579355423
 His revenge would have been complete indeed473.90210655112
      This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we      have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject      it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty      towards Mr12585318.879152553
 Wickham32.508982098346834
 I know not in what manner, under what form of      falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to      be wondered at9282.653046640162
 Ignorant as you previously were of every thing      concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and      suspicion certainly not in your inclination10384.399033341204
 You may possibly      wonder why all this was not told you last night969.3934025002737
      For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more      particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our      near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of      the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted      with every particular of these transactions1499022.5921096208
 If your abhorrence of      _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented      by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may      be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find      some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course      of the morning1729857450.9980211
 I will only add, God bless you128.8888609456014
       "FITZWILLIAM DARCY89.30540739253438
"     CHAPTER XIII51.5031401151251
   If Elizabeth, when Mr174.04646831911074
 Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents125313.60412552692
 But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited69205.9293440129
 Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined271.5835012256769
 With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal131601.6759014261
 With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield3148.479753950152
 His belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice1207888.2631871838
 He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty1833.2440019959179
  But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr264.9187142455923
 Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition641074.7123945032
 Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her359.84903588024827
 She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again1612397345.2722747
  In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence753419874.302497
 The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr26998.328433409417
 Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words4597.090520385917
 So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great1298.9851591079635
 What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err388250944.2106482
 But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate54478.60168823982
 She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success3871.122438827222
 Again she read on103.86845279437314
 But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr13912.91186096965
 Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole1021.5181752353196
  The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr165.96338292332402
 Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice2620.5739312772475
 She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance13581908.731352264
 Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself540.6041260217379
 As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring186247.56318498153
 His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue674.8586493844433
 She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr829.896792413057
 Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr8355.77047365027
 Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance119.90602632101142
 But no such recollection befriended her85.4650443760123
 She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess6727581.185778466
 But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question86345148.22824934
 At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr820985.1395285741
 Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration6373.156540263785
  She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr2137.0952181103453
 Philips's76.24862742441361
 Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory171.06601079015874
 She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before4259.981388119704
 She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct42442.59528639672
 She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr753.1833468912585
 Darcy--that Mr83.58807790936791
 Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week36537.639389644864
 She remembered also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr5688621.19796109
 Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son2141.7125433672936
  How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing634265.8087181011
 Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr1212.7689156463857
 Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits415199138.9068509
 That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling263171.8446939926
 That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr2007321.8708718233
 Bingley, was incomprehensible87.61167310518178
  She grew absolutely ashamed of herself102.87874959655399
--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd4188.125906197708
  "How despicably have I acted!" she cried214.30139901955917
--"I, who have prided myself on my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust28570.90534552407
--How humiliating is this discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind15908.817399582145
 But vanity, not love, has been my folly414.29770770122224
--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned1139216.1327934528
 Till this moment, I never knew myself541.3945473413224
"  From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr1479.7066091127253
 Darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again6619.236936712915
 Widely different was the effect of a second perusal289.10990550444814
--How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been4204805.333530744
--Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane353.3137014974232
--She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility136979.89217314552
 The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers11965168.068652958
 It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before59840960.025498256
  After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation6007901586.295976
  She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr2284.095413358192
 Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found2986008.6345603885
--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it183.39740227024237
 Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object362.7447725203643
 She could think only of her letter229.04426869885688
     CHAPTER XIV52.675062424389665
   The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr1104.5024371104823
 Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings557446.4742984263
 To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her141732333.87732494
  Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been108956004.45171541
 "What would she have said?--how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself488.56782867768095
--"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do19210034.932150252
 But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are14668.257102810583
 The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year640.2782188742449
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter2793.314866347903
  Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,  "But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer17510496316.49536
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure1825.8800456842096
"  "I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it645431.9294791635
--I must be in town next Saturday605.0899180529042
"  "Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks1475.047080109605
 I told Mrs81.17978757928378
 There can be no occasion for your going so soon431.698725034208
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight101.4123174073992
--He wrote last week to hurry my return98.1141158020287
"  "Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can259.838216999459
 And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large5250673819936.853
"  "You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan4099.916917218876
"  Lady Catherine seemed resigned117.52611529264347
  "Mrs21.43911708981833
 Collins, you must send a servant with them678.8900911424648
 I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing1799.9782009767268
--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life1279.7447960485335
 When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her1143.5868642819648
--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr690.0575520019606
--I am excessively attentive to all those things102.1628619188667
 You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs513.5660632428018
 Collins32.5170408942687
 I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone22232.501342902695
"  "My uncle is to send a servant for us352.0268998129522
"  "Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things272.05273695293886
--If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to3778.6486172620857
"  Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was17020946.85960368
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart4441.293411252771
 She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different354.58170811589355
 When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion962568.3199201489
 His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again216701.5528424443
 In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin92647.71465989988
 Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing1416114.9361595686
 They were ignorant, idle, and vain145.6475305148745
  Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr337.7629909392176
 Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost827.7972305216847
 His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend6326.05790184596
 The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh1156042124.7742536
  When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both3085555.5784361092
     CHAPTER XV42.21969295599913
 Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary22238.21303598092
  "I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs82135.61539165933
 Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it136399.71211796097
 The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you432.8040320499393
 We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode210.096242893594
 Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly476432542.03563845
"  Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness132.2457438631492
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,  "It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably232459.5147219545
 We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome75008.66353214394
 Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast930.115447989957
 You see on what a footing we are118.55140981872215
 You see how continually we are engaged there159.6970230118686
 In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings112265.6096169155
"  Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences508124.4973699194
  "You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin10727.470598453734
 I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so20621.24521829651
 Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs101.97982606821078
 Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage114238.86702835067
"  Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts82461.12995285429
 She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung32471.003167899093
 Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion822300.5677150404
 Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms7825.701806413388
  At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready2136.370152519751
 After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr739.9080062758751
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Gardiner, though unknown79.22753400092527
 He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings4062465.189170424
  "But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here1881725.8111161098
"  Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off2966.992146748425
  "Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!"  "A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh153915313.39668846
  "We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!--How much I shall have to tell!"  Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal806838.5524263157
"  Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr2352.67916378191
 Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days2491.130894961144
  Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them16651.572010885284
 Darcy's proposals77.14869971045175
 To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther1540421992045836.2
     CHAPTER XVI52.675062424389665
   It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr30901046.568831302
 Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs2007.5285589253851
 These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber1741.1759007962632
  After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?"  "And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there654228586.0564053
" Then shewing her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet1097.9008634153586
 I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not109404.78636817336
 I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better9413.452797436745
"  And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable110079164.7813686
 Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight826436.1193234496
 Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton73276.35871543287
 Lydia laughed, and said,  "Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion4242.844284002859
 You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say13333.277473866561
 I never saw such a long chin in my life713.3465184552775
 Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it? There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King23227.561366392612
 Wickham is safe80.84314851525674
"  "And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune735.5854581981299
"  "But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane24111.041750113054
 Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?"  Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!  As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it28624220125.332664
  "How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia332.2039450509673
 "I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home68350.58830473266
 And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away8280.920337785785
 Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back18284.981333094103
 Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare289.3790068985266
 She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr188.2489441978554
 Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it26189.095549874353
 Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls184952.40436933332
 Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's1208.6456161354508
 Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs707.091811504934
 Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs5539.607284142092
 Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col27066140.905464474
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least619301057.3470304
 Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs301.18698395329164
 Forster78.52383318695531
 I thought I should have died265.2427451270034
 And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter13621.347685448733
"  With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn4620.560735961945
 Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name13010.824997113183
  Their reception at home was most kind116.12231986194469
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr741.1988472983273
 Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,  "I am glad you are come back, Lizzy20927.97452015512
"  Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs33099.192591447056
 Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her13768502757.131006
  "Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too1235132883727942.8
 And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach1305.8522671760643
 I was ready to die of laughter192.90731436649637
 And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"  To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures889805.9646539444
 They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds152.9572667529734
 But I confess they would have no charms for _me_474.4747894697765
 I should infinitely prefer a book97.53586372623661
"  But of this answer Lydia heard not a word230.22644849292914
 She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all6198.754350643767
  In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme47967.601879308015
 It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers3467735.0847654967
 There was another reason too for her opposition145.87709517097596
 She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible5961.112588333953
 The comfort to _her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression2626.0305695175143
  She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents356276.67083015153
 Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last3939831.1120679243
     CHAPTER XVII79.28044708716925
   Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr31874660.095727745
 She was sorry that Mr87.36278534517679
 Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him3226.0629783272716
  "His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment62360.364699832775
"  "Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me1180213.9993202318
 You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"  "Blame you! Oh, no140321.02472919604
"  "But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham439.23652200678663
"  "No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did4041.7499272503746
"  "But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day28466.49156034637
 What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual17390.20829323308
 Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery1391.6983289032796
 Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other935.6291339739453
  "This will not do," said Elizabeth1734.5433867271913
 Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one4497.600443665646
 There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much16032.476811392546
 For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr1237.1759756741665
 Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse420.8637258665161
"  It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane4620.355822462708
  "I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she39279.775506561826
 "Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief280.9564443426753
 And poor Mr81.26535695035678
 Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing14797.928110981118
 I am sure you must feel it so518.6163185880379
"  "Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both2187.898968575658
 I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent4547.456292485744
 Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather3550.7918661098834
"  "Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner3771.1020524206097
 One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it4812.445601502538
 Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do781.6586324356781
"  "And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason6907.702605477706
 One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty829.0821529285552
"  "Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now91467.58321632785
"  "Indeed I could not317.3544255105031
 I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy578.7569931124691
 And with no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"  "How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr1555656731.874806
"  "Certainly78.73485541760458
 But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging1505.190282332889
 There is one point, on which I want your advice549.9118199409875
 I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character7036.10055947929
"  Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully3667.038826648176
 What is your own opinion?"  "That it ought not to be attempted67591.87884227738
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public231.37337391682246
 On the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr33550527.027361922
 Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light31783.99729979773
 I am not equal to it298.90463455633875
 Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is3521.039715027551
 Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before10182.576978522628
 At present I will say nothing about it121.60516901947754
"  "You are quite right126.32319391774331
 He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character2568.6103906342296
 We must not make him desperate148.72180644138245
"  The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation298.07998143169743
 She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either34585.69502055468
 But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure1286.4131546184947
 She dared not relate the other half of Mr153.45244283293002
 Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend3631.255552141086
 The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"  She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits349144.6190230503
 Jane was not happy87.0532952317307
 She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley125.63305041092224
 Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity613756053.159706
  "Well, Lizzy," said Mrs630.8434980529232
 Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody1003650.4793274073
 I told my sister Philips so the other day267.9504651986342
 But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London1877.8250086240882
 Well, he is a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now189831.37337370482
 There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know1843807.2409151404
"  "I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more702.2300091852491
 Nobody wants him to come142.16079041249276
 Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it239152.79292324686
 Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done330530.3279149186
"  But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer1599.2340366219294
  "Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last937870.3120508303
 And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say874.8831163004656
 If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough2003.531828261308
 There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say1018.3693068672579
"  "No, nothing at all151.887508425832
"  "A great deal of good management, depend upon it1424.32145548963
 Yes, yes123.60456732251822
 Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead2546.268262948932
 They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens1772.9334481456326
"  "It was a subject which they could not mention before me5282.920314747058
"  "No101.69738877530179
 It would have been strange if they had480.6096155891068
"     CHAPTER XVIII77.21224586946984
 It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace45749.72108865397
 The dejection was almost universal89.54759592121634
 The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments1078.4887053121263
 Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family43625.098872969495
  "Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe2004.5725639567518
 "How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?"  Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago25880.022469722106
 I thought I should have broke my heart298.42415847524273
"  "I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia19303.443095126968
  "If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs244.47404786396513
 Bennet25.669748167391045
  "Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable537.8372966030181
"  "And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good," added Kitty43548.53153614721
  Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house245.43086590882046
 Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame934.8292977304611
 She felt anew the justice of Mr147.63971870424527
 Darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend1099.1828221832159
  But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs373.33982697861336
 Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton1263.6769546834184
 This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married2631.1133201551543
 A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_84074.77176850372
 Forster, the delight of Mrs84.07563095511098
 Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described2461.4328971032587
 Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish3965.9316352355227
  "I cannot see why Mrs148.5732396613565
 Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia," said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend1422612.205355458
 I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older8193.382643579733
"  In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned17169.034943740913
 As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go98006349.07653575
 She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs3098.2291628399635
 He heard her attentively, and then said,  "Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances11693822.632822301
"  "If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair47240563.03107408
 Bennet25.669748167391045
 "What, has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down784.9841561957526
"  "Indeed you are mistaken226.55678161696707
 I have no such injuries to resent225.81392219441773
 It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining1945.0940319665585
 Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character9865.77366115452
 Excuse me--for I must speak plainly149.10997831898402
 If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment193523912.52367425
 Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous5290.512900175088
 A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite29992.969800716204
 In this danger Kitty is also comprehended99.45325987365463
 She will follow wherever Lydia leads89.26385799032109
 Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"  Mr14105735.308236398
 Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly sisters120505.44068489262
 We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton772.761862080019
 Let her go then151.1689340010068
 Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body118324.40964619404
 At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here1684.4815865319183
 The officers will find women better worth their notice113.70602973683224
 At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life3488.905795937394
"  With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry15593.31064600677
 It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them4165.7290804230715
 She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition7185.459199887708
  Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility5487.904373722849
 In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness204.4469820414212
 She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers169.69315755447644
 She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown870.3584821147783
  Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same368064.30110953253
 Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself2158.612589476354
  But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home7278.698419021703
  Elizabeth was now to see Mr137.7809273819275
 Wickham for the last time254.1638824677042
 Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so896.7338917751576
 She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary1078.1825841624172
 In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her1000204.7255773954
 She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal3836843.95282364
  On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr156063537.32936805
 Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former3691.3287698394743
 Her answer was warmly in his favour212.81463365293203
 With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you say that he was at Rosings?"  "Nearly three weeks3938590.5775761926
"  "And you saw him frequently?"  "Yes, almost every day4318.958245144847
"  "His manners are very different from his cousin's473.1150968235462
 But I think Mr120.69378931554799
 Darcy improves on acquaintance87.85668365661918
"  "Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her2714.065926711889
 "And pray may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style? for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials119740473.85825875
"  "Oh, no!" said Elizabeth985.3773361962375
"  While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning3832.0518374995654
 There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,  "When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood14930472.394011829
"  Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,  "You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr4096823.9135214053
 I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe125127.08658176582
 His fear of her, has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart72373288.35142024
"  Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head3657.0617130923592
 She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him14392.488281747508
 The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again1540902.202804025
  When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs225.67498975657978
 Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning1554.7047033339181
 The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic450.43174931250314
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard263001175.91235393
     CHAPTER XIX52.675062424389665
   Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort8527.97571519597
 Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her653381.4370934959
 Respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown681.9688542450046
 But Mr53.36218908690127
 Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice3540.395576115151
 To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement3078.9221780703083
 This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given21609.26184070695
  Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband10673.132565876607
 She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible21023227.280092712
 But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife118871.19070294309
  When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment3587.114735844011
 Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp59395949.53191959
 Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself1552850.3984428586
 Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect7731902.391190329
  "But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for54498.10794488025
 Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain154.28564836758682
 But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized1746.837579918359
 A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation1145.0021376816335
"  When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short22848.375660726015
 Those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs175759435461.59167
 Forster called her, and they were going to the camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public13644435.63653591
  After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn1353.5766484379972
 Everything wore a happier aspect96.27086079345167
 The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose8179.208745016053
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton28938853.404181376
  The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs17192.20851661735
 Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent109.83136054670237
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire429816870962.9341
 In that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs84379.05663817553
 Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction105.42624925426543
 The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak1859608.3792207334
  Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough2355.0408150025887
 But it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again3405.1033214009926
  With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected1330.902419708329
 It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner3873.8167444099468
 "But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me13341.945345585451
 But they did pass away, and Mr259.68901773437636
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn157.9178874561609
 The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them5364137.785144983
 One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad801.6808644496751
  It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c67615.23456394584
 A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern263.2034761752752
 To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs130.7381076908147
 It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it878.0463077014621
 In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs257.09819384671937
 Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again261.16428301402607
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation1017.1980297838028
 "A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected322.19917069181133
"  Elizabeth was distressed81.7217881334046
 She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it199047.13584189568
 She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains2418.063213269081
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Gardiner abused her stupidity83.75083639728393
 "If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful1432587.820176752
"  Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce120.30830292577114
 The possibility of meeting Mr173.30384266821898
 Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred304.145748162596
 It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk81896.38699213456
 But against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered1651198.6391060753
  Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer382320.01072670374
  To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go9337.474909486828

     CHAPTER I42.30409824657876
  The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground150.4557038921692
 They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent1753.6890249773426
  Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view1305.0080865553002
 They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound217780.37765894286
 It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance1518.8310510270455
 Elizabeth was delighted83.8576346132298
 They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!  They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned29828392.214136865
 She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken135.66500793359307
 On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was5299496.942756799
  The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her2442.8004998156193
 They followed her into the dining-parlour218.3336310056169
 It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up176.40489641469
 Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect457.568075449319
 Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight2519657.693600063
 As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen460.273489713562
 The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings1127718.397598885
  "And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt63655522.130723685
--But no,"--recollecting herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them94393.86670432592
"  This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret116.12821176708225
  She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it1063.1139572000445
 At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs10120.784929477773
 Reynolds replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends231983.53147565274
" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!  Her aunt now called her to look at a picture771.3467809691454
 She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr365.6413289296524
 Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle-piece114.05461103523328
 Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it294.99619535501466
 The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence565487.1359446794
--"He is now gone into the army," she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild337687.4554494126
"  Mrs21.43911708981833
 Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it4963.12273650664
  "And that," said Mrs393.60935636542706
 Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master--and very like him656.8334518011604
"  "I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs2959.5534872027533
 Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face2039.0244071202353
 But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not1443.9261728598512
"  Mrs21.43911708981833
 Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master178.91625538691005
  "Does that young lady know Mr143.54030413155746
"  "And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"  "Yes, very handsome50159.77911157302
 This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then1823.736987680246
 He was very fond of them326.72733208066825
"  This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr94.95386648388649
 Wickham's being among them84.60700839009456
 Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old12809.732308743976
  "And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr2918.886604647994
 In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him347.6379189237941
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs192.44521147533544
 Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister2285.979324926999
"  "Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate6049.5387545010535
"  "If your master would marry, you might see more of him332.69437872828104
"  "Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be44751.78387291222
 I do not know who is good enough for him444.1964499781069
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Gardiner smiled81.13849017992328
 Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so4666928.413499996
"  "I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him," replied the other122376.5099614325
 Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old36658563.32364492
"  This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas246.37468658660134
 That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion10447.714254053815
 Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying,  "There are very few people of whom so much can be said659296.4242163964
 You are lucky in having such a master107.44345719026005
"  "Yes, Sir, I know I am2165.023440178003
 If I was to go through the world, I could not meet with a better17593.60702256064
 But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world292591.50534853863
"  Elizabeth almost stared at her96.54117989220369
--"Can this be Mr118.25829779679927
  "His father was an excellent man," said Mrs738.600621523889
 Gardiner27.360418439559684
  "Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor57287.0652596498
"  Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more721.5061222108365
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Reynolds could interest her on no other point107.08057871425797
 She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain20051.360199913994
 Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase627102.2544675206
  "He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived257717.82927907733
 There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name1914.3896110850656
 Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it84181.18732668977
 To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men6744.040022064507
"  "In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth445.3518384795669
  "This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend832088.1071228625
"  "Perhaps we might be deceived140.70980555200788
"  On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley171314131.40523946
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room620.1331685970018
 "And this is always the way with him," she added9957.476833358816
--"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment2304.407832190268
 There is nothing he would not do for her605.0443693182165
"  The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shewn3820.8101619352237
 In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible1188898.9077641792
  In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger2534.0881404062925
 At last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr133.25548251411183
 Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her76447.39904314706
 She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery563.1196653951968
 Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time5432.372923330505
  There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance23860.957885907144
 Reynolds was of no trifling nature98.85836732571708
 What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression117803230684.91028
  When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door44169.53181637493
  As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables3335011.3373430055
  They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight108921.77434499958
 Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush2363.110904200793
 He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility477153.5518957107
 Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr2144.954311832997
 Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it446.70131791635
 Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life6162283.008368871
 Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts91068887.52509429
  At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave337253.8767431245
  The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence818060.9409533351
 She was overpowered by shame and vexation87.65292084021948
 Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage27250495818.499
 She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting483.39166199891963
 What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it32174.374289248302
  They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene202786288802.97293
 Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr2001.7418114209156
 Darcy then was78.67617756237755
 She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him7022269.637915791
 Perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was not like ease228873.8374776507
 Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure220806.2123733586
  At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself110056.9121324019
  They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream802848.0329571676
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk1267.7636300070892
 They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it2083737.535732752
 Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs9426.924515691444
 Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible26893.84462919001
 Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr1786411.2530401729
 Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little1191988.4482822507
 The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met1813.406170027034
 Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them35825.917189514024
 For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path70026.09681755326
 This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them1143.2089696722148
 With a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed1396313532881.8406
 Her colour changed, and she said no more847.9308658197338
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends213213.2111997826
 This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself2045660.7652828794
 "What will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion6525.747635900662
"  The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions214782675.90932164
 That he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr248383.54907117368
 Gardiner27.360418439559684
 It was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush16316.987613393127
 She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners54307.37845380383
  The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr1143.3437209703534
 Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport2196410.0567674623
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder905.1528852335641
 Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself1604.8011543985579
 Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened1536565.550182299
 My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this198.24327757898578
 It is impossible that he should still love me570.5603399842382
 It originated in Mrs87.15288451639196
 Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's3406.8577451054844
 She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country14155342394.53746
" He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling560808.8698280627
 "They will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr10953.392474164231
"  Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow378.61640776797896
 Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr339.05543002489463
 Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged79846.88671720859
  "There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"  The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it382635319.57780594
 Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased1527.708273591643
 His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind12107.993012230783
 They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr11724.707693728342
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward2139.003382672861
 She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject973.958283705845
 At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance26620.802104875704
 Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over288.40845126567194
 On Mr78.58887546162723
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness516529.0690947917
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house4402.28072201593
  The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected10335.096856271613
  "There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming13587143.141935207
 I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it13624.587143152694
"  "I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us1233.8555240341243
 It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention23976.00403728778
 His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling201.93051867097557
"  "To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good17410826.91249609
 But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?"  Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning199561586.96545097
  "But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle3376.743220817032
 "Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds51376.57279312988
"  Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing2207.7845691780076
  "From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs1332.6691716807727
 Gardiner, "I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham212732.5863703047
 He has not an ill-natured look168.2917872274549
 On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks905.5288968246425
 And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart12501.245394754964
 But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes53394.12548135538
 But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue57402.43293084496
"  Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire188921649646.1924
 In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on1105853.3590291895
  Mrs9.62941339842944
  The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr98486.27629751877
 Darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister9250.64457098094
     CHAPTER II52.66659867208486
 Darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning593185.6129657673
 They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street50927803.269541636
 Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected503.6637313192603
 Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business1003155.1402754312
 Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece49563.54705512377
 While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing165.73291376581454
 She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her20213.124885953144
  She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse2465141.594411029
 Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy11171323.253265025
 She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable173.06042125768323
  Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful413176.78614066495
 She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle69543.28884388904
 Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr1288.1113937670568
 Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings303.58485970053374
  They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room355640775.3984793
 All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again127275.98668596838
 He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done26202.207028964265
  To Mr77.36292384156303
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself141.7540885168356
 The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention1175.6497723553343
 The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr111.97986806461351
 Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love48500.661857801024
 Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough471.498740007403
  Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do798.9827819904108
 She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour1799940406.6598506
  In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner86757.44519180358
 Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister287.29105035175155
 On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared30830486.425569605
 He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months121349026434.92358
 We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield1163.1466732589145
"  Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn321660.45456675166
 There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning111085.3851944095
  It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr1790.4635322912102
 Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day77344790.15905067
 When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible5672289341.533391
 Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings43554460.385935985
  Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr12646.027558774556
 Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr455.44241117044294
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country19740.768325452023
 Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed3181.396018862535
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head24287.9560680599
 Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on28886765.767553706
  Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends268375.5147018183
 Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little222134163.1723453
 Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress701186.2384920738
  But she had no reason to fear Mr1648.4198901537452
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication2214.5360646054405
 It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr2129.5675983234164
 Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her162477.6864106597
 They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry210.28352645393298
  Of Mr77.11920361880807
 Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find699852.4001669112
 They could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr100603227.12773174
 Darcy18.017419673323744
 There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected15327923.32966586
 They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town, where the family did not visit41435.80405242224
 It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor98753.34478879027
  With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr992758524.4203389
 Darcy afterwards discharged82.97961681367711
  As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out348706839.77201205
 She certainly did not hate him99.85122903637878
 No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called46383.891547491105
 The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced4295433.925519025
 But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked12482.54635666469
 It was gratitude81.53800836863078
--Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection83156.61660415903
 Such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined24084149.902646504
 She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses31267161785.34119
  It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning4256690552127.977
 They were, therefore, to go707.8676479373404
--Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply28365.04546285248
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Gardiner left them soon after breakfast220.9786685370268
 The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon21165.077161860918
     CHAPTER III52.66659867208486
   Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed2344795.458191782
  On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer12225.928422536568
 Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn16682.63968135382
  In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs3457.1015011017607
 Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved16375.673153791737
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her1833.3293133898014
  By Mrs77.40337466932796
 Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments454778.60539845214
 It was first broken by Mrs89.89337935257649
 Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs13029.575111846947
 Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on267.09459728433734
 Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard105200.26931334216
  Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention26773578.944246076
 This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much656543.439453542
 Her own thoughts were employing her100.95441770307481
 She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room611.0387034936576
 She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine32872.91174085576
 After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family17329.273167974457
 She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more1506.0394612770785
 Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post1742.8694574812032
 There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table275685.07281233626
  While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr899.8887853061767
 Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came431030.68597949215
  He had been some time with Mr399.92993978959777
 Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning3548971.3730946244
 No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room41166929.2312973
 In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr249214.38423054415
 Darcy were by no means over450.2749878256901
 Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side30495494.748975363
 Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,  "Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to _your_ family193589389.852969
"  In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone3253931.5598474825
 While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes75144.3081601229
 Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps10207020786.31653
 To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own682583.7390266857
 He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend335363.85343055107
 Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress3012.8912370128774
 But Georgiana would not join her96.46372590434801
 Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable1209921.5395348675
 When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister254964.54626635058
  "How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr298.80066325796076
 Darcy," she cried; "I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter141529.90101554245
 She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again1809.1509508285008
"  However little Mr89.54468738316086
  "For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her69595.99410670294
 Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome2448.3387383472204
 Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines420.0633281181486
 Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them731861.2684325103
 They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable1851947.3410964885
"  Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected2594155.6243615826
 He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,  "I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_ a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit224780603160.25848
' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time6378.146075468058
"  "Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_ was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance252559339.622376
"  He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself975069.0244217541
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both4182.072075384265
 The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention2090.699905921326
 Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject657.2650488559989
     CHAPTER IV78.18617665945537
   Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere692644219.0963278
 Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill907.7380581654056
  They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves15079.078805039708
 The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago674.1294960257733
 The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence66420.33640901948
 It was to this effect:       "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of      a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming      you--be assured that we are all well418623.9754376943
 What I have to say relates to      poor Lydia558.4549586373655
 An express came at twelve last night, just as we were      all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was      gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,      with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise864612.1511515047
 To Kitty, however, it does not      seem so wholly unexpected8945.690499609684
 I am very, very sorry208.51544315037654
 So imprudent a      match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that      his character has been misunderstood4526.634735358738
 Thoughtless and indiscreet I      can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)      marks nothing bad at heart1263.1989837456297
 His choice is disinterested at least,      for he must know my father can give her nothing1237.1255105046732
 Our poor mother      is sadly grieved132.55613315040333
 My father bears it better84.22621198857026
 They were off Saturday night about twelve, as      is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at      eight204.46884696091254
 The express was sent off directly122.87386771695088
 My dear Lizzy, they must      have passed within ten miles of us1224.4798480069405
 Colonel Forster gives us reason      to expect him here soon161.60781478601658
 Lydia left a few lines for his wife,      informing her of their intention898.9416025678763
 I must conclude, for I cannot be      long from my poor mother1776.0196332183514
 I am afraid you will not be able to make      it out, but I hardly know what I have written1813909.7668721918
"  Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first7223578.244921786
       "By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried      letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not      confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer      for being coherent87271.26074588625
 Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would      write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed809644.8211863813
      Imprudent as a marriage between Mr112.57629933321616
 Wickham and our poor Lydia      would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for      there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland38394.99598542484
      Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day      before, not many hours after the express1021.8559201992524
 Though Lydia's short      letter to Mrs122.84465032205274
 gave them to understand that they were going to      Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief      that W2515.025367676052
 never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which      was repeated to Colonel F14661.281031454928
 intending to trace their route102.3081328348751
 He did trace them easily to      Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed      into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them      from Epsom396.4960886175166
 All that is known after this is, that they were seen      to continue the London road6698.498411940503
 came on into      Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at      the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such      people had been seen to pass through25687.4250140628
 With the kindest concern he      came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner      most creditable to his heart2045.5241598649802
 I am sincerely grieved for him and      Mrs108.2605061483523
 F26.66281758952031
 but no one can throw any blame on them281.3539612415664
 Our distress, my      dear Lizzy, is very great1968.0444400477015
 Many circumstances might make it      more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to      pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design      against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,      can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible3878636.2552996394
 is not disposed to depend upon their      marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he      feared W4662.7024641780645
 was not a man to be trusted663.3411005447938
 My poor mother is really ill      and keeps her room196.8624136227521
 Could she exert herself it would be better, but      this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life      saw him so affected10552023.959762536
 I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared      something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock      is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so      selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient619134441.4569123
 Adieu84.48969563860555
 I      take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,      but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging      you all to come here, as soon as possible11167265.176979885
 I know my dear uncle and      aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have      still something more to ask of the former290954.78495487035
 My father is going to      London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her715.7573995422271
 What      he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress      will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest      way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again      to-morrow evening6887528.838743399
 In such an exigence my uncle's advice and      assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately      comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness95055.30663451379
"  "Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr23212199.27756819
 I must find Mr85.61615749156633
"  "Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr3896919.3617656743
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Gardiner27.360418439559684
 You are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself175.39248835458997
"  Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them11760.84242575947
 Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly20625.084603806834
  On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid456211466.00691885
 Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very ill860.346735284423
"  "No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself3676.5158330952954
 "There is nothing the matter with me328.5148673766158
 I am quite well196.09788712131575
 I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn1005.8047625585309
"  She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word18485.923724306653
 Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence894.0573843857225
 At length, she spoke again198.8826256896869
 "I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news4291.360847333638
 It cannot be concealed from any one195.18282314314536
 My youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr137.7442311448001
 She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever317.48335038954957
"  Darcy was fixed in astonishment96.83337052376078
 "When I consider," she added, in a yet more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew what he was2151388.5084847417
 Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened72601.6650279537
"  "I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked4629.698772696145
 But is it certain, absolutely certain?"  "Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland638881.4376351556
"  "And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"  "My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour294806351.65448546
 But nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done941.5944039663299
 How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope46412.33485628644
 It is every way horrible!"  Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence340.812535558477
  "When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character944.3228887297373
--Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much7391.67450273506
 Wretched, wretched, mistake!"  Darcy made no answer264.89170287168366
 He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy21597.872286884958
 Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it145.92885967088776
 She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress1228.929558888388
 It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain3155562.422506167
  But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her1124.0606395235577
 Lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern102691517316896.75
 Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress1163.923008983853
--But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks1721.931185160004
 This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day2757.3181151758854
"  "Oh, yes118.64073760941302
 Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy577.2430083361737
 Say that urgent business calls us home immediately103.81116742922524
 Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible375.3930015582549
--I know it cannot be long755.6781498862088
"  He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away10550.880372707825
  As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination249026150.90158644
  If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty265.5806724941664
 But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment223272824.97414306
 Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business17537.953812153126
 Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her778.6762284027988
 No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation2333.2228429024985
 Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement625.2592173849553
 While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible1947058.6568252419
 But now it was all too natural311.46995475321745
 For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey9056836.573774902
  She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body1043453.9840397572
 Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion816.0271644293696
 Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object176.00874395721777
--Oh! how acutely did she now feel it246.48295829766423
  She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe7444489220.965435
 Mr7.688630579355423
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy75337.62359442546
--Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr996.0226678149824
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Gardiner could not but be deeply affected169.2497479811222
 Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr6809.447570054851
 Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power291.73880067703107
--Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled7119.526991922633
 They were to be off as soon as possible3554.789641731975
 "But what is to be done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs2955.0747649887576
 Gardiner27.360418439559684
 "John told us Mr90.6105479829927
 Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so?"  "Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement476292.38706115616
 _That_ is all settled474.43721610333176
"  "That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare10193.979030456368
 "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"  But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour646400.4845055077
 Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure69739053.54543969
 An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr3270.0724717625385
 Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn804770879.1926811
     CHAPTER V52.53769296248504
   "I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter965363836.623431
 It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best1361891.2817196713
 Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk6775.664146606278
"  "Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment14295.665048548804
  "Upon my word," said Mrs561.399808303601
 Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion1742.8169180980997
 I cannot think so very ill of Wickham258.81252225818304
 Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"  "Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest2507963.391752341
 But of every other neglect I can believe him capable222.2642014132353
 If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it28791.573546374104
 Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?"  "In the first place," replied Mr1068689.56169165
"  "Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road9349.383929167967
"  "Well, then--supposing them to be in London920.3585811105727
 They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose431.4442401554411
 It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland242664.71123355927
"  "But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely18181.219956127366
 His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her1283.1231988155644
 Wickham will never marry a woman without some money123.28257601474988
 He cannot afford it82.56144360306823
 And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce533304911.2160334
 But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good5751.170527587868
 Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter375717912.52669924
"  "But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"  "It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt189600212467.7632
 But, really, I know not what to say1827.8258880415221
 Perhaps I am not doing her justice519.1238807677335
 But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity128311.04856431161
 She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way64396.673495881834
 Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head44889.20413813753
 She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough224243.5329720456
 And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman845.6302251986515
"  "But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt895175.2109332341
"  "Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is754496.6344938251
 We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word1087.027233346365
 That he has neither integrity nor honour218.4802831029632
 That he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating2280.3143495655904
"  "And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs697.1569842791504
 Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive784.092419205102
  "I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring9846.833063779515
 "I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr2011.1949409053682
 Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him207419.07732777257
 And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless99699.05592105722
 From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl22351.295729437996
 Yet he knew to the contrary himself123.43450961302614
 He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her5085.952703417647
 Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr1439.4094311669373
 Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself9184.201664860795
 And when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time9678.997734842538
 As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs256251538.0609223
 Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me1809.2370885319274
 That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head704.7544192143444
 That such a consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts2294.0562947951985
"  "When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other83167.20877396809
"  "Not the slightest110.10752868971927
 I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away3711201.6989947967
 When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were26785.130537813726
 Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites124728272.92734681
"         *       *       *       *       *  It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey433850.029549525
 From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent103.11563503481469
 Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness1060.463578094955
  They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day1944.6083559440283
 It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations4236.190427796687
  The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome92495017.61162163
  Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her53311.32451774092
  Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives19783.397308137293
  "Not yet," replied Jane729.6732097582214
 "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well2405.682988184217
"  "Is my father in town?"  "Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word8760.533871551599
"  "And have you heard from him often?"  "We have heard only once16656.86201656179
 He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do1907986.550877962
 He merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention13513.272559753346
"  "And my mother--How is she? How are you all?"  "My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken61156.15461943627
 She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all821.2625191119535
 She does not yet leave her dressing-room269.37036139517517
 Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven! are quite well293.9739373187975
"  "But you--How are you?" cried Elizabeth623.4993058677128
 "You look pale123.09849633996643
 How much you must have gone through!"  Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr10497456.550489116
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party41667.08387028117
 Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears5871.205128609865
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing2915266.2867480237
 Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after73802348.72762021
 I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am99507.29704136826
 Poor dear child! And now here's Mr101.56545749068009
 Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do60462943759.6137
"  They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr113.3857718321887
 Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr8027711.159542212
  "Do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain244126.50212023788
 It is not quite a week since they left Brighton401.3131240718179
 In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost3585635.1168944077
 As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done16527705.29627305
"  "Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs2542.292430769124
 Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for830.2989689323601
 And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry283364.7836699025
 And, above all things, keep Mr116.06128385157386
 Bennet from fighting82.25945945726811
 Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day391550.9003761737
 And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses101772.46299884809
 Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all511.8264846132979
"  But Mr80.75230126873028
 Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters1877959343.493686
  Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject29364150387.975365
  In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before114508.73448004435
 One came from her books, and the other from her toilette1905.733120668494
 The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty147143683.31558692
 As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,  "This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of497898.0511049098
 But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation1425.0231296553418
"  Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex596218.3133721185
"  Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply4175.691112172837
 Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them3536.0864353661555
  In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy263482.87913583056
 After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have not already heard209453792.21489182
 Give me farther particulars100.07314299688115
 What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever8539.292594409108
 He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey211623.17151882657
"  "And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"  "Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it19673951.767787483
 He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before799822.9587095908
"  "And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"  "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right1831459432.422894
 My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be4091.5587568190394
 She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks20574.27338499137
"  "But not before they went to Brighton?"  "No, I believe not20913.44352715329
"  "And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he know his real character?"  "I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did1389653.954175166
 He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant404.2624027479463
 And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false340927.67021749297
"  "Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"  "Perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister8468641.613532376
 "But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable605.0123473881873
 We acted with the best intentions102.83655896340186
"  "Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?"  "He brought it with him for us to see76312.12702043694
"  Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth349.6155918732782
 These were the contents:       "MY DEAR HARRIET,       "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help      laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am      missed10323175.202547414
 I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with      who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the      world I love, and he is an angel7010279.770296033
 I should never be happy without      him, so think it no harm to be off1531.466760430675
 You need not send them word at      Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the      surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia      Wickham2439184.5383917815
 What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for      laughing2127.541430339283
 Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my      engagement, and dancing with him to-night279.43051458591646
 Tell him I hope he will      excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at      the next ball we meet, with great pleasure151379.9808331254
 I shall send for my      clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally      to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are      packed up52345.274808395254
 Good bye53.27412258155672
 Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you      will drink to our good journey2788.7710569616224
       "Your affectionate friend,       "LYDIA BENNET245.2303106586869
 "What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment6107.710041869818
 But at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey6607.613901694309
 Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy10320.941416941378
 My poor father! how he must have felt it!"  "I never saw any one so shocked31417.01197884035
 He could not speak a word for full ten minutes553.7130737960559
 My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"  "Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"  "I do not know606528979818.2175
--I hope there was130.4460715959049
--But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult1479.9680506722361
 My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties177750124.07690716
 You do not look well175.726233031996
 Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone9778.808582715763
"  "Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them1770256.8229737515
 Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on4879.457698614689
 My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me9004.50313269809
"  "She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours284478.88159978285
 Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable107.17343129720663
"  She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter50163.10032395522
  "He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them330266.0396765444
 His principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham845.1222219503485
 It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham172343.4858327909
 If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach32509.42268014113
 I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this27296206.99973385
"     CHAPTER VI76.9912565002754
 Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him1962.1307413168324
 His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion29425.1135255428
 They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain690044.2589532597
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off253.80924453644312
  When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr109988.86258432567
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 She shared in their attendance on Mrs99.7678426237494
 Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom12679.02743017733
 Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them149915.07818547857
  All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light4092.738762466687
 He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family78369.34279635907
 Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness3846160.8202809864
 Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them199885169821.7341
  Mr7.688630579355423
 That Mr77.97153260754304
 Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr1886370.8651196733
 Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings84823.66159309924
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it32018.06430485192
 He added, that Mr464.8661130727386
 Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon4533.286695907955
 There was also a postscript to this effect185.93434752072702
  "I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself10947679.6228575
 At present we have nothing to guide us245.1429209366142
 Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head14646.199639563803
 But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person1905.9456204956539
"  Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved448601.6402946734
  She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years5011.502199772649
 It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to1233830392.1520348
  Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected3047.9872454772785
 The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience425.7896943256043
 Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance181246.45885007494
  But before they heard again from Mr88.97329603366632
 Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr1537.5250037839348
 Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise1113588.1447336613
 It was as follows:       "MY DEAR SIR,       "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation      in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now      suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter      from Hertfordshire6288651.4597374825
 Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs1724.1659223411173
 No      arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe      a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that      must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind2547.076935940444
 The death      of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this4238.33980394072
 Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own      disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of      such an enormity, at so early an age317351.61828678113
 Howsoever that may be, you      are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined      by Mrs19583.094513971093
 Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,      to whom I have related the affair8226.652856749068
 They agree with me in      apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be      injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady      Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves      with such a family233520.9826369846
 Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,      to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy      child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the      fruits of her own heinous offence1016256.7642114892
 &c83.66093081230585
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send7821.343512137774
 It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living176587.06743285173
 There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him3362.174880228607
 He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable3065.437930325776
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror679.9605483855757
 "A gamester!" she cried185.5042200941999
 "This is wholly unexpected186.0009733822954
 I had not an idea of it301.9980144122962
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday93138.00131103539
 Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit1485802.4988550656
 When Mrs78.78614081111763
 Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before8628.21211961032
 "Sure he will not leave London before he has found them535.7395454072628
 Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"  As Mrs36750.99539453302
 Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr3396711.055002589
 Bennet came from it96.59537292808875
 The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn5375.4158092633525
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world4088.921231073999
 His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs8442.323089988218
 Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing3466.5868785800776
 Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley594.0698799784466
  The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better51102841620.93905
 It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two2574.5989740639684
  When Mr36.198926912249625
 Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure3577.6771056731777
  It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that20304915.44742415
 Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it26288.197598304323
"  "You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth3144.632966668119
  "You may well warn me against such an evil148.38327825051368
 Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame475141.4690694608
 I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression213.93778095052008
 It will pass away soon enough97.83509590654029
"  "Do you suppose them to be in London?"  "Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"  "And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty40179160.9141623
  "She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration112689.74889602144
"  Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind196849.96079191563
"  They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea8392.902343138896
"  "I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if _I_ should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia2896432.1465756167
"  "_You_ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it392799.08977343113
 Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters1422.2694659888307
 And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner13417.864484461154
"  Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry498.5743200600314
 If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them12949.353205128558
"     CHAPTER VII76.9912565002754
   Two days after Mr87.00034697270434
 Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask2004151549943450.8
"  "What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town719.9652389256186
"  "Dear madam," cried Mrs957.4738414889835
 Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr232.5740003577987
 Gardiner? He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter3196.84813845935
"  Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech462.0061842638827
 They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said,  "If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse149803994.72790867
"  Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock692772.2073740022
  Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out,  "Oh, Papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?"  "Yes, I have had a letter from him by express2336187926089.294
"  "Well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?"  "What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it102824281.9083096
"  Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand106.73446211111282
  "Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is about681379.2543764402
"       "Gracechurch-street, Monday,       August 2191.8791080261741
       "MY DEAR BROTHER,       "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such      as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction164296.70898709397
 Soon after      you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what      part of London they were7114.512706215573
 The particulars, I reserve till we meet233.96664036234017
      It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them      both----"  "Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"       Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both5439324471.772638
 They are not married,      nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are      willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on      your side, I hope it will not be long before they are22604163.25908677
 All that is      required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her      equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your      children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,      moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your      life, one hundred pounds per annum3173080.2814535764
 These are conditions, which,      considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as      far as I thought myself privileged, for you73649.1444614146
 I shall send this by      express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer582.1206380462031
 You      will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr137.83190289945304
 The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to      say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are      discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune1558125.372681159
      If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act      in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will      immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper      settlement247668.82417286333
 There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming      to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on      my diligence and care41296.064925576175
 We have judged it best, that my      niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will      approve11652.474161194521
 She comes to us to-day99.47264436096776

 GARDINER27.360418439559684
 "Can it be possible that he will marry her?"  "Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister935380.8040699431
 "My dear father, I congratulate you437.71634352619355
"  "And have you answered the letter?" said Elizabeth652.2981558512142
  "No; but it must be done soon2945.997694918481
 Consider how important every moment is, in such a case1033.928092271772
"  "Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself63001.58516139672
"  "I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done36978.15114049174
"  And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house10870.259135050474
  "And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with272199.44665163435
"  "Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little814.2657412854377
"  "And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!"  "Yes, yes, they must marry95186.17949720606
 There is nothing else to be done511.9923363685122
 But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him175596.98192029202
"  "Money! my uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir?"  "I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am gone51215472.63337191
 His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself55492.00230837717
 A small sum could not do all this164.14282958753572
"  "No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds59611.41915125503
 I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship15372.239908340942
"  "Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?"  Mr493.4348650470405
 Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house7802.722889960473
 Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room21435.30058434973
  "And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves191625.90854662826
 "How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful1322.6855170263416
 That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!"  "I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her7172912361.793558
 Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced57341.108605697045
 How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"  "If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr50554685.933946475
 Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own503.54079658746633
 Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge1604.4057527424507
 By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!"  "We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy2273103030.547555
 His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking109931.7181180908
 Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten40567.82645996155
"  "Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget59024.34325789856
 It is useless to talk of it158.60818607359573
"  It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened3108.1883308275346
 They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her1239235.3180855622
"  "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"  "Take whatever you like, and get away3770.6101238612864
"  Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together4688.636030551293
 Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs188.70238003117225
 Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all660.9950720096643
 After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud262.8290540137752
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet could hardly contain herself85.86894448583242
 Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance735.3904834500387
 She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation6272.851746051946
 She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct263.5650653821309
  "My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried: "This is delightful indeed!--She will be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage every thing61770.98888262887
 How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly7130.48731738361
 Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her5226.3392998160725
 Stay, stay, I will go myself833.0909014664165
 Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill502.08275867087343
 I will put on my things in a moment160.9481025397552
 My dear, dear Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!"  Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr51005.52826347584
 Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under90.95386827406341
  "For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure, to his kindness17497.136201449368
 We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr430.40864808429274
 Wickham with money86.48525416361427
 Well! I am so happy592.9248420214253
 In a short time, I shall have a daughter married3468.2717617484223
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Wickham! How well it sounds105.33351453716979
 And she was only sixteen last June786.1972800164882
 My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me2322669.033469039
 We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately630.5958871769004
"  She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted1500804.0090656248
 One day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual132293.11484674976
 Other schemes too came into her head113.1614736575784
 And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs1238.711046494187
 Long51.7485417937919
 Kitty, run down and order the carriage149.6521980953005
 An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure2290.241732892908
 Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill1799.534964363937
 My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding163061.01898012627
"  Mrs21.43911708981833
 Hill began instantly to express her joy175.49105147645517
 Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom192650.83187556296
  Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful106381.12566477884
 She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained2759073.9796730685
     CHAPTER VIII42.21969295599913
   Mr7.688630579355423
 Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him20987694.432566617
 He now wished it more than ever108.89895604728015
 Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her4911.733140683518
 The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place28785.92826852025
  He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could109416296.97279139
  When first Mr76.82756507652738
 Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son31549.592021160857
 This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for283820.47543564974
 Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs3610.2226088964103
 Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would2874.3210772065922
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income1141.8839351165018
  Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs233.88493025573155
 Bennet and the children91.01066181916512
 But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents1458.1335301179258
 This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr26207.771649402406
 Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him369.40688544649356
 In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him696605.0846063042
 He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement147396.5224865161
 He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum5741810.3966352325
 When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence905.9796837074248
 His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution3253.626716886212
 He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any message to her7672.967143980277
  The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood1444.3607871950755
 It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy211.4624314745427
 To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house9728845.558701698
 Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high19043.43119682488
 No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph118.00564536701238
 The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants6655043.312862139
 She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance29142.928706205046
  "Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful111950173.77472341
"  Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained449.125400268688
 But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs4649.801656912267
 Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding2290.198706702875
 Into _one_ house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance499.5282529404757
 I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn882.9340746812002
"  A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr115.53565926084156
 Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs129.62366131707654
 Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter1290.2695195197623
 He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion3355.1857586033825
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet could hardly comprehend it82.62433032587785
 That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible182744.58018292213
 She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place26997.45654397667
  Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr20666.112144850154
 Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot11018.006612796906
  She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means589.6604034057118
 Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr4899.900850596606
 Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned3978.889214164641
  From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink6543.231967496486
 The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this39984.720241464376
 She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what6522.984430626896
 She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it7077.205085388695
 She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence4403.176455976766
 She was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet128493.90670215253
  What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex3927930.9669048246
 But while he was mortal, there must be a triumph358.3001756589053
 His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes1893.7477350224074
 It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance9130975.94997529
  But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was112.53290353566754
 An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family5496.203219351765
  How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine6827.609690891987
 But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture1421.1077876173763
         *       *       *       *       *  Mr296.6859938160988

 The principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr1942.9254768600053
 And I think you will agree with me,      in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both      on his account and my niece's7080.797077842474
 It is Mr80.63863607097215
 Wickham's intention to go      into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still      some who are able and willing to assist him in the army26073.343099022535
 He has the      promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in      the North3418.3624395120623
 It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of      the kingdom4457.310260070254
 He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,      where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be      more prudent9329.174871488116
 I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of      our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the      various creditors of Mr9990.547264189012
 Wickham in and near Brighton, with      assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself608.7988603473678
 And      will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances      to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,      according to his information14636.69407059272
 He has given in all his debts; I hope      at least he has not deceived us1186.5766230145075
 Haggerston has our directions, and      all will be completed in a week834.8387820013762
 They will then join his regiment,      unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from      Mrs5456.227907198892

 Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr2697.394812368743

 But Mrs53.40104713505464
 Bennet, was not so well pleased with it1110.4778552339735
 Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites8000186968.395209
  "She is so fond of Mrs140.12925628251898

 But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished21697919101.024506
 And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North510483.34749519284
 When Mr36.198926912249625
 Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn9182956.690522471
 Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes6780276.937938772
   Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself4603.130080361966
 The carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time698754.6035219802
 Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure92978.97040821343
 Smiles decked the face of Mrs158.15278168297726
 Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy2717.3206101995816
 Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness393596.6165230416
 Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial3736.264812802158
 His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips527.3868892201766
 The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him6756.922659936516
 She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there1427992759.9001765
  Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all1570652.985635084
 Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man17475.062077827137
 _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour12864.41907165335
  There was no want of discourse240.38965402124538
 The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies1232112.373251711
 They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world3242.044215486184
  "Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time301570.116165669
 Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was4836044.750829677
 Jane was distressed77.80799828612906
 Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing3239874391050.3228
"  Elizabeth could bear it no longer103.17140954641124
 She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour44687.095571831785
 She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman6626388.948807129
"  It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first61518.70061759128
 Her ease and good spirits increased197.62173324615875
 She longed to see Mrs96.60426109887065
 Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs7060.099365975854
 Hill and the two housemaids171.10336496292516
  "Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me710168927.8534751
 I only hope they may have half my good luck171.30630516412796
 That is the place to get husbands191.00918208146226
 What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go810.6572811494608
"  "Very true; and if I had my will, we should3433.0048924844323
 But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off721.7127699093603
 Must it be so?"  "Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that14270.940672621966
 I shall like it of all things117.7551302470541
 You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us495.0834675052914
 We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all2089877.2951309031
"  "I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother4193.802460326045
  "And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over154452.82380211807
"  "I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands1069406.7355290295
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight54093.36135175379
  No one but Mrs96.67561356658713
 These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not1508.5193581232375
 She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion17498871521364.467
  Lydia was exceedingly fond of him101.22947792149236
 He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him1537.2418342191957
  One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,  "Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe207566725.62950313
 You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it28669.28251330063
 Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"  "No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject2585537.946099098
"  "La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off3608.6920697693045
 We were married, you know, at St1083.796859786751
 Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish131.2740995948707
 And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock921.7819850439776
 My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church233111.08770238276
 Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted25947929.48203697
 And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon4359.363697721061
 I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat712.3685586315373
  "Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them73492300.27567121
 If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight29358.670811241733
 Not one party, or scheme, or any thing382.17603649793955
 Stone84.25860509329632
 Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day60486229.26010432
 But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out7613.421427155348
 However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr12903.633013361665
 Darcy might have done as well144.81486992162837
"  "Mr25.892549922914036
  "Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know3450.548976455787
 But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it890.8185064178579
 I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"  "If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the subject79192500.24351262
 You may depend upon my seeking no further180.99438666999433
"  "Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions17072.08655489213
"  "Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry8384057.1732657
"  On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away5258.837111986148
  But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information10158.946203970672
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy had been at her sister's wedding204.20206207267336
 It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go2415.860032978479
 Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none154238.90096222312
 Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable716.175053828285
 She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended263504.93361077993
  "You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time3759674.8789232234
 Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance166827.95235152787
"  "Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out1933774648.5868063
"  Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante59278.93957587283
     CHAPTER X42.21969295599913
   Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could4474.652725336644
 She was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial646337472.6601529
       "Gracechurch-street, Sept124.89406732836387
 644.50752002077778
       "MY DEAR NIECE,       "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole      morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will      not comprise what I have to tell you4331007.298025468
      Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,      that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_      side1382156.637950867
 If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my      impertinence494.76015043723004
 Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing      but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed      him to act as he has done9648.177197675117
 But if you are really innocent and      ignorant, I must be more explicit2584.8614263307745
 On the very day of my coming      home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor2643.1012456354783
 Mr7.688630579355423
      Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours1611.9373014659711
 He came to tell Mr190.5763584336134
 Gardiner that      he had found out where your sister and Mr1285.5426698524552
 Wickham were, and that      he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia      once15077.472954483774
 From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day      after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting      for them1398.3710691943004
 The motive professed, was his conviction of its being      owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well      known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,      to love or confide in him773592.8699324307
 He generously imputed the whole to his      mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath      him, to lay his private actions open to the world15062.769596909668
 His character      was to speak for itself126.00589194697538
 He called it, therefore, his duty to step      forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on      by himself27193.223783541143
 If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never      disgrace him6778.186843393779
 He had been some days in town, before he was able to      discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was      more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another      reason for his resolving to follow us357562527.780615
 There is a lady, it seems, a      Mrs336.8427132816521
 Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was      dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though      he did not say what6210787.542349279
 She then took a large house in Edward-street,      and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings335.40352511922885
 This Mrs78.35507267149268
      Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he      went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town562173.9968032769
 She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery      and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be      found50233.04591828285
 Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in      London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they      would have taken up their abode with her6375255.5576068
 At length, however, our      kind friend procured the wished-for direction454.12746418341817
 They were in ----      street1215.018885935265
 He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia661.3724799880083
      His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade      her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,      offering his assistance, as far as it would go88463245.85970606
 But he found Lydia      absolutely resolved on remaining where she was195.57540833584164
 She cared for none      of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of      leaving Wickham25089.95831769754
 She was sure they should be married some time or      other, and it did not much signify when53501.95840550454
 Since such were her      feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a      marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he      easily learnt, had never been _his_ design745290.0044673354
 He confessed himself      obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,      which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the      ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone44530.90845230436
 He      meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future      situation, he could conjecture very little about it11654.496514407525
 He must go      somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have      nothing to live on658670.9444449504
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy asked him why he had not married your      sister at once502.8102366182836
 Though Mr76.91089503842157
 Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,      he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation      must have been benefited by marriage13434849.072210338
 But he found, in reply to      this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more      effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country5141.193184580703
      Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof      against the temptation of immediate relief58315.84886075182
 They met several times,      for there was much to be discussed811.24158032823
 Wickham of course wanted more      than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable1676.5781154332947
      Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr271.581683061046
 But Mr53.36218908690127
 Gardiner      could not be seen, and Mr1032.7794384810568
 Darcy found, on further enquiry, that      your father was still with him, but would quit town the next      morning19789.96319645637
 He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could      so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed      seeing him, till after the departure of the former46052.38860027312
 He did not      leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a      gentleman had called on business132901.96316407764
 On Saturday he came again103.34085159858232
 Your      father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they      had a great deal of talk together1130931.6469979284
 They met again on Sunday, and      then _I_ saw him too5071.207107170647
 It was not all settled before Monday: as soon      as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn13034.325655352584
 But our visitor      was very obstinate100.60786651349338
 I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real      defect of his character after all1553.6286155061007
 He has been accused of many      faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one2963.3127300849965
 Nothing was      to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do      not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your      uncle would most readily have settled the whole319101633.5809184
 They battled it      together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman      or lady concerned in it deserved2422.69917435643
 But, Lizzy, this must go no farther      than yourself, or Jane at most803.0116175577316
 You know pretty well, I suppose,      what has been done for the young people7870.094828807448
 His debts are to be paid,      amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,      another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his      commission purchased1214166.653328746
 It was owing to him, to his      reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character      had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been      received and noticed as he was2266671.507366885
 Perhaps there was some truth in      _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_      reserve, can be answerable for the event23235.216722493187
 But in spite of all this      fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that      your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit      for _another interest_ in the affair3583535.5738769476
 When all this was resolved      on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at      Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more      when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to      receive the last finish90590935.9295401
 I believe I have now told you every thing360.4692141260555
      It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I      hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure13649.624241715419
 Lydia came to      us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house471.5470862789526
 _He_ was      exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I      would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour      while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter      last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a      piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no      fresh pain6376821682789.208
 I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,      representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and      all the unhappiness she had brought on her family353290.134540215
 If she heard me,      it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen207113.2256151266
 I was      sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth      and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her5536.076675304721
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy was      punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the      wedding1606.6900561370494
 He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again      on Wednesday or Thursday12562.091258650076
 Will you be very angry with me, my dear      Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold      enough to say before) how much I like him558982.051499956
 His behaviour to us has,      in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire2255.1449919013294
      His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but      a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his      wife may teach him47187.5530918778
 I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever      mentioned your name121.83076269942549
 But slyness seems the fashion85.40770613665268
 Pray forgive      me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so      far, as to exclude me from P138160.3182037149
 But I must write no more175.080138731747
      The children have been wanting me this half hour144.06364298181646

 GARDINER27.360418439559684
"  The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share10443.507316689058
 The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr114.08446294589595
 Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce273205552628.88425
 He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem1129.6338173682032
 Her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her3985.990750641805
 But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham13643716.399408368
 Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection234.60323244239993
 He had to be sure done much508.3634361397603
 But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief768.5593900897164
 It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned53876125331.33034
 It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return8703.760705735514
 They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing to him1820.4129197251475
 Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him2382.288479919109
 For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him1070.121932489738
 Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself29364.647115229756
 She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again434.49199907459604
 It was hardly enough; but it pleased her811.5639180990248
 She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr1339.6335728812112
 Darcy and herself84.798843234005
  She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham169201.90869046244
  "I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her219719.68278855737
  "You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome138513.01132736861
"  "I should be sorry indeed, if it were1894.6049339999129
 _We_ were always good friends; and now we are better1222.7169198237705
 Are the others coming out?"  "I do not know3744.3607448459493
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton240.36390346392628
 And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley106634.5586349703
"  She replied in the affirmative308.9405827758243
  "I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle280763.8867162518
 And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me20884.936645054408
 But of course she did not mention my name to you1289.0363767687977
"  "Yes, she did461.4953351313491
"  "And what did she say?"  "That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well396782.57988738
 At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented8967.765780122976
"  "Certainly," he replied, biting his lips650.2247995971231
 Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,  "I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month76869.07640558633
 We passed each other several times99.79429976269432
"  "Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth4492.548029741222
 "It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year1251.978999017356
"  "Undoubtedly77.18805860849028
 Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had1168.2971986947437
"  "Yes; he introduced us to his sister169.48011072446457
"  "And do you like her?"  "Very much3143.5220453035713
"  "I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two26721.964163556408
 When I last saw her, she was not very promising5566.129255411613
 I am very glad you liked her176.87634356840044
 I hope she will turn out well101.74925569003331
"  "I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age1128.7322402781908
"  "Did you go by the village of Kympton?"  "I do not recollect that we did16662.362363067852
"  "I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had11329.227901572178
 A most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect1854.2919848274353
 I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing30765.600436389035
 One ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be245880786.22336608
 Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"  "I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron290099742.131721
"  "You have105.13072397034156
 Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the first, you may remember110375.70208368398
"  They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,  "Come, Mr56260641.27625204
 Do not let us quarrel about the past166.15686284380573
   Mr7.688630579355423
 Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet71650807.49782947
  The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs468.8481414379453
  "Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"  "Oh, lord! I don't know2335305.2638673326
 Not these two or three years perhaps317.29149195664525
"  "Write to me very often, my dear796.1469945925568
"  "As often as I can233.0414664498064
 But you know married women have never much time for writing121.82197963373116
 My sisters may write to _me_199.34547088435272
 They will have nothing else to do215.95184490845583
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's159.8373020295118
 He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things1179.7700513099808
  "He is as fine a fellow," said Mr1124.294196281422
 Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw139739.65301655701
 He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all195.5668881069765
 I am prodigiously proud of him91.22383236345512
 I defy even Sir William Lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law332.87117398712246
"  The loss of her daughter made Mrs520.427808400771
 Bennet very dull for several days93.67042114153531
  "I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends55954.03729888408
 One seems so forlorn without them84.26889321125964
"  "This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth22330.804259568966
 "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single187.08683967883005
"  "It is no such thing146.04844819057192
 Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off1229.1439889009127
 If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon7139.175864464508
 The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks36201.24656256601
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet was quite in the fidgets88.1681211811157
 She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns1899.0952090325263
  "Well, well, and so Mr1272.6027077713452
 Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs341.61461113535836
 Philips first brought her the news106.08331274263479
) "Well, so much the better470.80143464764865
 Not that I care about it, though1017.1142264910219
 But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it70162.197033291
 And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us990.5543845685681
 You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it1200.1561067141538
 Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true2624289.6995218787
 He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday151.88380683465357
 She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed220180.88443143017
"  Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour26858.703548421872
 It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,  "I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed1467612806.9845107
 I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at6248.412287594639
 I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain4197.48589826391
"  Elizabeth did not know what to make of it1492.8398008951388
  "Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself346302.97822478734
"  In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it2853767.906339204
  The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again11360.367731559445
  "As soon as ever Mr623.7120180730959
 Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs1176.3735170694827
 Bennet, "you will wait on him of course785.2998255421579
"  "No, no145.17244550573423
 You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters16109.030165912667
 But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again13120.099380226784
"  His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield3409.4995324951265
  "'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he821.1221113625596
 "If he wants our society, let him seek it180.86414555738887
 He knows where we live89.96037293011781
 I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again13296.812314590994
"  "Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him98163.60018426843
 But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined8657.540363311595
 We must have Mrs86.7220371028626
 Long and the Gouldings soon92.87964902562605
 That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him637.8279419351886
 Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_ did1834.0723428109839
 As the day of his arrival drew near,  "I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister4632400.490828374
 "It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of335068.3162714534
 My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she says61355.191036806464
 Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"  "I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power31041136.90734895
 You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much22690.525101116553
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Bingley arrived81.76126884960387
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could2033291.5856315384
 She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before416.37372539259064
 But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house21557.038537617427
  Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy149.54001998139893
 Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr25766.88572678641
 Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister2728.9042979485644
  "There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"  "Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know9679071072.09467
"  "La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before3986.0519299599882
 Mr7.688630579355423
 what's his name93.51244596908272
 That tall, proud man89.59990544500502
 Darcy!--and so it does I vow104.44794635971162
 Well, any friend of Mr98.52966858471714
 Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him2934.696756366751
"  Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern111.47843341383539
 Both sisters were uncomfortable enough96.917195356346
 Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr163617.48802443844
 Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr2570.1401711112762
 Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them380.43908290732475
 But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs317044.34556002147
 Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him523.3614577515109
 To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley5262097257.372663
 Her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire89343.06459382837
  "Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation53810.2693048611
"  She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door132806.90358422216
 Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected637.9760061054159
  Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command13971.2399012218
 She had ventured only one glance at Darcy106.15320799848062
 He looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley1330636.26929339
 But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt7749.362668570246
 It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture473.9782424639815
  Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed6347.515871301375
 He was received by Mrs89.8798993977649
 Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend3153.1167848909604
  Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr179.36539966504174
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing3486.3137821597265
 He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire76584.64613034375
 There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself8556.180069616294
 But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground844463.6225412833
 More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed338.1074162227584
 She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so138.0157955650717
  "Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she3860.426225590739
 "Yet why did he come?"  She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak209130.0907834393
  She enquired after his sister, but could do no more532.4991525178274
  "It is a long time, Mr638.0783364545782
 Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs1740.3249403375212
 Bennet25.669748167391045
  "I began to be afraid you would never come back again328.67470579445444
 People _did_ say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true757719.9274101827
 A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away1165.8177903496617
 Miss Lucas is married and settled93.9366061900633
 And one of my own daughters580.5528194379576
 I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers36095.786834325576
 It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be62553.17934618593
 It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq331.54399701067734
 Did you see it?"  Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations6815.296659610312
 Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes129.16981289305832
 How Mr76.47552807559613
  "It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr21117362.758145597
 Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me5650.88247591153
 They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long25812.90812984069
 Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves955.30134552486
"  Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr326.55054559880995
 Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat8062.848326804524
 It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present16413882.112636527
 A few weeks, he believed233.61045184200626
  "When you have killed all your own birds, Mr383.0092507346248
 Bingley," said her mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr201852.44114462685
 Bennet's manor76.67375533126823
 I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you31182.403223635327
"  Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion558710.8855710628
 At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion1694.2645564098561
  "The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them1165787.0658668187
 Their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!"  Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover177064.28113799458
 When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention7869.146284983098
 He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty132672.14209088183
 Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever52678.75181674074
 But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent16700.506291014146
  When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs417.7736812287188
 Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time26757.224145436463
  "You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr463.6112336444362
 Bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned694646.7151293453
 I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement759885.8777353007
"  Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business12452.632098772016
 They then went away118.6085294552223
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year88901466.75772606
     CHAPTER XII42.21969295599913
   As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more3843.4083918823612
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her83.64592134215222
  "Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?"  She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure1820014.5279975375
  "He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teazing, teazing, man! I will think no more about him16323755.52911837
"  Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth57942.27116909178
  "Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy31770.727243501064
 I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming3228.768670374007
 I am glad he dines here on Tuesday162.0217110629628
 It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance671.0365191925878
"  "Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly4516.867956607485
 "Oh, Jane, take care307.58671411645815
"  "I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever8937.122141397273
 Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived722961.3436001759
  On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two, who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time3472094.4192143963
 When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister424012.85141513764
  Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend554.9078223455467
 Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm540.3793662827899
  His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured331796734.2763713
 It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour5137.15541764134
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them3865.7420439412817
 He was on one side of her mother616.3170191964143
 She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did316510.01956805494
 Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family2910998.8631732576
  She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance248226.94159993753
 Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil2676.372670440299
 She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend2920.0461663615274
  "If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for ever614168.5806920747
"  The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair3072827498.6000414
 And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,  "The men shan't come and part us, I am determined6116082.376832439
 We want none of them; do we?"  Darcy had walked away to another part of the room1756.6603703990427
"  "And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"  "Mrs1944.4417344272836
 The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks147.77393870543415
"  She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success116974.22267898898
 He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away3039720.373298612
  When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party690122711.8449454
 She now lost every expectation of pleasure159.5370574785565
 Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them174135.90319640862
 The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw128.83078981588096
 The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week; and even Mr770.4307709958631
 Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least47862.26154683921
 And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty20972.373789941914
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not810.5468554441643
 And what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs447.08988500700946
 Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last442.1507482572591
' She did indeed126.04882398826797
 I do think Mrs95.59360689144226
 Long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously8829.512497615891
"  Mrs21.43911708981833
 Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals414048244736.84106
  "It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth16572.75226577467
 "The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other156.74225135064535
"  Elizabeth smiled83.56939388851342
 It mortifies me83.39298075922743
 I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it18568.423878733967
 I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection3652.0449684049627
 It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man22635.198072620202
"  "You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment1906090.125445677
"  "How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"  "And how impossible in others!"  "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"  "That is a question which I hardly know how to answer1400075516.8512235
 We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing473.9501069752488
 Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your confidante44553.724599888585
"     CHAPTER XIII51.5031401151251
 Bingley called again, and alone490.95845835184497
 His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time2380.8015910644563
 He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits4729.275906529871
 Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere16666.01451786414
  "Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky34026.39846231799
"  He should be particularly happy at any time, &c444.4038683401519
; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them3424.775521787491
  "Can you come to-morrow?"  Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity90823.89264711634
  He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed81632.35983939684
 In ran Mrs80.54980239837587
 Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,  "My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down282798.20169952634
 He is come--Mr79.11296389412432
 Bingley is come85.83645677024882
--He is, indeed137.656612716652
 Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown1331.486295003248
 Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair84.35853718333533
"  "We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago317594553.03342754
"  "Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! where is your sash my dear?"  But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters971654.8468949132
  The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening908.0598226595578
 After tea, Mr86.20608192975091
 Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument2617.4410006194844
 Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs156.67136864019028
 Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them437.227927366046
 Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"  "Nothing child, nothing107037619.65781659
 I did not wink at you184.74980078487428
" She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,  "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room7871056.346396164
 Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it33414.77846003749
 Bennet half opened the door and called out,  "Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you149934.51215675593
  "We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall538728.9599380824
"  Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room109076.3010955067
 Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual98.30721864050638
 Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter1095.7090592754946
 His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter55455.731790880585
  He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs5093.249295082404
 Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband835.7027314172947
 Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr6249.521250545621
 Darcy returned within the stated time98.48966890799744
 Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence6335.589473477232
  Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr541.3641758672929
 Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on404.8557231584135
 The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected123.97495222706996
 There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him78025.79970858534
  But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her770943.3820756259
 On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all1374956.8102521016
 _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she thought was still worse1110.4922764499304
 Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room30468495.6694449
  Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world442183.13051351224
  "'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much4704.444991858705
 I do not deserve it202.98753723646436
 Oh! why is not every body as happy?"  Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express1192.085346491361
 But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present388390.3059831524
 He is gone to my father already217.07197274983608
  Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation35258.106501893715
  "And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"  In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose201351459.44574955
  "Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door26851.65752139517
  "With my mother up stairs103.12535336542304
 Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship511.83589142018127
 They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself1181466797380.4612
  It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever84478.3561344935
 Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon312.2277494075152
 Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr374045.50446673343
 Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was347.43011531793474
  Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said,  "Jane, I congratulate you68150287.34682217
 You will be a very happy woman649.031321432091
"  Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness1231.5939000262108
 I have not a doubt of your doing very well together439.2700165748772
 Your tempers are by no means unlike405.1018861286666
 You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income39329.597636917504
"  "I hope not so201.11955779735862
 Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in _me_727.1319440504237
"  "Exceed their income! My dear Mr324.6058350677268
 Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more266624.1844912966
" Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night8402869.0849587
 I knew how it would be787.3206174733375
 I always said it must be so, at last878.2195734783672
 I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together9629026.45714806
 Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"  Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten1499.3568465193898
 At that moment, she cared for no other418.97603394295743
 Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense3165.628302714899
  Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter1948.716992193303
  Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept45642941.18106858
 In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief6269385.190889272
  "He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible22464950.731683515
"  "I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth700.1267793871012
 "But how did he account for it?"  "It must have been his sister's doing86411.51377778951
 They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects18354.11809915072
 But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other6461020.759175033
"  This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities5010.522057615336
 Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness751.299632345234
 No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr558021.4701763235
 Collins in time87.84297759047318
"  The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret3390.562526944531
 Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs97.33362982576793
 Philips, and _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton9638.259191748388
  The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune1197052.9370091986
     CHAPTER XIV52.675062424389665
   One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn93321215.91018888
 It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours11277.819681391464
 The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them1224.4879762680225
 As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery264936.2412938124
 They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered140317.7162260497
 It was lady Catherine de Bourgh228.54895570473184
  They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs7368.664393952547
 Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt8141.763181255271
  She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word51604.846524293964
 Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made7088.922957184471
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness758.328624943705
 After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,  "I hope you are well, Miss Bennet2051224.7191841146
 That lady I suppose is your mother169.1298376011465
"  Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was533.3809390954798
  "And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters4762.440193205353
"  "Yes, madam," said Mrs1073.3504948584946
 Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine320.7717479419077
 "She is my youngest girl but one155.7856631284275
 My youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who I believe will soon become a part of the family237651.92746676545
"  "You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short silence1466.0918122779317
  "It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's866227.2107016706
"  "This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west8034.993424259419
"  Mrs21.43911708981833
 Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added,  "May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr121756.14561327282
 and Mrs16.88876820682175
 Collins well81.08528709729521
 I saw them the night before last119.78728189511718
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,  "Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn654867776.3181198
 I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company60454.31522551603
"  "Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the different walks57420.55440354096
 I think she will be pleased with the hermitage752.5565025795395
 As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on126076.9507753618
  Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it11353.82455824891
 They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable22599.918770352662
  "How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face43268.10509874859
  As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:--  "You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither2167598.330231116
"  Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment84.00533143541269
  "Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam1046.2408127250123
 I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here8380.99704622795
"  "Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with252841199.0850535
 But however insincere _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so53194.083350170906
 A report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago365.99883401880635
 I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr1899162.5953786597
 Darcy18.017419673323744
"  "If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far2466213.619572787
"  "If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"  "I never heard that it was4292659.5400737235
"  "And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"  "I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship129116.203455254
 _You_ may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer4327.317013648816
"  "This is not to be borne733.8157433916973
 Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"  "Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible95141.77775975606
"  "It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason25303.373412169327
 But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family205126.45927639888
"  "If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it11177.247387768768
 I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns2868.44622505022
"  "Let me be rightly understood119.9162917663678
 This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place802.8381379123512
 No, never87.79844350797639
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_159.19218693021264
 Now what have you to say?"  "Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me2394924.4680533973
"  Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,  "The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind44551.057111372334
 From their infancy, they have been intended for each other166.50516951998853
 It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of her's3837.5530559180484
 While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"  "Yes, and I had heard it before65380600960782.164
 But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh4392230.377662889
 You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage695.6564769572983
 Its completion depended on others85.43415199969522
 Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"  "Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it344318.1307558969
 You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him863.293436291085
 Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us801.5841504226975
"  "These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth583.1852168449576
 "But the wife of Mr140.62009324574535
 Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine23813.84252201551
"  "Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score?  "Let us sit down7948.447941392843
 You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it27196.35335976195
 I have not been used to submit to any person's whims538.8127487505075
 I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment478.1194352164982
"  "_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_8922.768979223818
"  "I will not be interrupted451.23440750675303
 Hear me in silence108.32558147527288
 My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other154.01056259594864
 They are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families28566.301077105283
 Their fortune on both sides is splendid123.3879912397493
 They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune40970.200008072876
 If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up234661.93342688875
"  "In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere1359.002615781257
 He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal1997.8953281501458
"  "True75.68418995477288
 But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition651.361783309402
"  Lady Catherine seemed pleased123.75925250460065
  "And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"  "I will make no promise of the kind24831.98378316623
"  "Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished186.28574695517557
 I expected to find a more reasonable young woman201.91174186338145
 But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede182.86650634818167
 I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require1762.1785217178845
 I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable576.9595027521411
 You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these1499.9804866989307
 How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine7069.814523640243
 I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject5708.499863348046
"  "Not so hasty, if you please683.6419633520147
 I have by no means done410.61101237909
 To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add6634.554903893745
 I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles26368.34713222358
 And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is _her_ husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"  "You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered2486631229.8174706
 "You have insulted me, in every possible method942.7013522146979
"  And she rose as she spoke321.6690689565664
 Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back1062.0948109673884
 Her ladyship was highly incensed127.82203785774331
  "You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"  "Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say9207793406.11663
 You know my sentiments82.96619919203194
"  "You are then resolved to have him?"  "I have said no such thing14595.258617219311
 I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me85251.02057074473
"  "It is well177.77233910461544
 You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude142.67960213108825
 You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world87998.32880617076
"  "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance67534.26052478346
 No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr761.4911152190693
 Darcy18.017419673323744
 And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn78181978.97965772
 I shall now know how to act214.27142844421522
 Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified6657.2394568899035
 I came to try you96.38442474470202
 I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point432.5278944062748
"  In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,  "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet11569767.80388638
 I send no compliments to your mother159.4314851121058
 I am most seriously displeased88.57492588113797
"  Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself29686.399461039768
 She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs140.64629373933607
 Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself1407.9583533466866
  "She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go437443.4604315193
 She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you12099.479302653632
     CHAPTER XV42.21969295599913
   The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly135848.62525304878
 It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea5856158217.561084
 She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together4340.220099184356
  In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference112926.48552265871
 From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce31417792.784916013
 She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side2098136119.6879642
 With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning1640.4241029371874
  If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him2794331.575943646
 In that case he would return no more190.4134030978795
 Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way9933.682778321341
 If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all81998.70322611829
"         *       *       *       *       *  The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs17507361.410941366
 Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject2441.242348055766
  The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand2745518.5214282153
  "Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room70092.95051628142
 It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations16272.96402766327
  She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down5280.33001887179
 He then said,  "I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly5912.271567119627
 As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents382.0245539605676
 I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony10232.127712223735
 Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest280.541361396159
"  The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,  "You look conscious42200466.30855172
 Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer126671.19888026464
 Collins32.5170408942687
"  "From Mr121.50951949974917
 Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?"  "Something very much to the purpose of course121562.3654402857
 He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases21093.921044321592
 I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point420.37166250921047
 What relates to yourself, is as follows121.11078482411871
 "Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs103.71251593727112
 Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority24270.409050044273
"  "Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage345920.73222845845
 Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of7218220.590567642
"  "Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out1878.3456719248172
"  "My motive for cautioning you, is as follows150.72339291360464
 We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye31043.360288980664
"  "_Mr87.19501934532165
 Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you155441.89172822563
 Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr19948.175066308297
 Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!"  Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile6469080.292613045
 Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her748.6544144746365
  "Are you not diverted?"  "Oh! yes7202.916765560418
"  "After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match22282539.819177095
 I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned1099287.9886717307
" "Mr25.892549922914036
 Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known939184.1031538068
 I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married112527.25962703877
 It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it3441.3646612316134
 You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing837.5719499850208
" "_That_ is his notion of christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch179974.62391910696
 You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report25045.39634079722
 But it is so strange!"  "Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing3750.7438709893504
 Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr81422858.96391167
 Collins's correspondence for any consideration93.88356763247872
 Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law33251.75282595577
 Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not17088.531846076206
 It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried814.933939671057
 Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_651117.0366929091
     CHAPTER XVI52.675062424389665
   Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr445.081254751013
 Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit14707.70037740909
 The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs890.3201290768893
 It was agreed to162.14376858155364
 Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them1406.0414287136362
 They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other3424.2626490586426
 Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same25125.41837049616
  They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone158839.83145643747
 Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said,  "Mr24399.703699686946
 Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's1002987.2779541189
 I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister306.0194600944091
 Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it45449.649872464244
 Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express32941.257368191145
 I did not think Mrs230.66736568118787
 Gardiner was so little to be trusted161.23390465391
"  "You must not blame my aunt180.2496068296788
 Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars290863.51534397335
 Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them298813.1782840521
 That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny53870.14801464969
 Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of _you_20122.392410390763
"  Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word420.722625603099
 After a short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me21958.458806537255
 If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once765.0914923880525
 _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever1565.2064277044308
"  Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances6572508.369739965
 The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do276741.2339728607
 Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable26945037533.574837
  They walked on, without knowing in what direction402.11732539097375
 There was too much to be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects33200.59453622691
 She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give1186088883324.4202
 But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise423.8524573523862
  "It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before61831.08253564978
 I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly99847.2598842028
"  Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_219890.75367533654
 After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations1864.4579644970465
"  "What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof836251.0397383297
 It was unpardonable81.01795582451204
 I cannot think of it without abhorrence148.9324484459436
 "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility18110.40783187906
"  "I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself603.2307976327803
 The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me2118533.633829156
 Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner1537.8414319811516
' Those were your words87.40970064274292
 You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice14213.828872655127
"  "I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression812.2511685982191
 I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way24175.658282592412
"  "I can easily believe it182.32520899511664
 You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did1388.5970520877943
 The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me66105.93821875563
"  "Oh! do not repeat what I then said251.77666623512889
 These recollections will not do at all256.4875413495912
 I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it3718.498949971067
"  Darcy mentioned his letter93.34300040674047
 "Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"  She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed10905805.159181934
  "I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary88466.82687159178
 I hope you have destroyed the letter342.3820171548227
 There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again12949.276601071566
 I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me108.45842201618491
"  "The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies970881.5016447895
"  "When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit14595351.97104135
"  "The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so10458.243163701814
 But think no more of the letter484.38468449578113
 The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten905313.509612866
 You must learn some of my philosophy108.72671311580267
 Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure282.9448695663385
"  "I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind237.83083184134193
 _Your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance146321.07190318126
 But with _me_, it is not so6162.4200206315945
 Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled1405.3978622622953
 I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle5131.0674925922185
 As a child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper3289.2245000816756
 I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit165.61425561635488
 Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_) I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own269908996.04052967
 Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous5390.535764854762
 By you, I was properly humbled767.0525758087733
 I came to you without a doubt of my reception288.98470802779616
 You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased258.96535834917654
"  "Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"  "Indeed I had10449.480944315255
 What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses707.1064315143103
"  "My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you4576.058351547566
 How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"  "Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction731574.7671386243
"  "I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley698.0990440923299
 You blamed me for coming?"  "No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise3209.7929264473255
"  "Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you1997.108655794593
 My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due101255.28003090847
 How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you23481.006378642724
  She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther26507.99146855851
  After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home232537.86775186245
  "What could become of Mr90.48989429912403
 Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs782.4126130013183
 Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it699.2964959253649
  "Not at all157.97441500441826
 I guessed as much93.57654462808549
" And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case7271.68567408642
  "On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago3416566.2238361975
 His surprise was great91.01375253312065
 He had never had the slightest suspicion170.1720865121388
 I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together354195907.29701364
"  Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend319.0877122331153
  "Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"  "From the former6046382.144850159
"  "And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him6302.678308584877
"  "It did104.1595212982119
 His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy4467.991847748541
 I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him10656.9928453306
 He was angry84.07253899893851
 But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments5133.159915842253
"  Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr192.22403198846874
 Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself3492.062632244714
 She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin7799.095866166493
 In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house48282.19041745095
 In the hall they parted166.1306473967663
   "My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table75431264.3851773
 She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge26953.92873938857
 She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth4604.918648136992
  The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary328.3588542926615
 The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent157.216574909529
 Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her7015429.437371685
 She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away217431.19117774378
  At night she opened her heart to Jane127.74277257049124
 Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here1955.937385571443
  "You are joking, Lizzy220.42076719428908
 This cannot be!--engaged to Mr85.4920887416777
 Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me1187.9181557713623
 I know it to be impossible235.2481274861208
"  "This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not593353.3966244943
 Yet, indeed, I am in earnest6116.084916553231
 I speak nothing but the truth170.43102480239227
 He still loves me, and we are engaged1109.7560987977417
"  Jane looked at her doubtingly283.4884512778179
 I know how much you dislike him214.4034557215842
"  "You know nothing of the matter228.767249275957
 _That_ is all to be forgot422.65215699367445
 Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now2631.680958385107
 But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable445.68549630882535
 This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself390.2190206084838
"  Miss Bennet still looked all amazement141.72112770766677
 "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"  "There can be no doubt of that3884289.6923278198
 It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world6432.771854233879
 But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"  "Very, very much31667.49550633456
 Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight99.02779834348907
 But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible313.439128103204
 And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection2250.833345164208
 Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"  "Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all39690269.5808982
 I am afraid you will be angry596.7269483970325
"  "My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious381.0131484356377
 I want to talk very seriously163.03206009629096
 Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay4542.743015966976
 Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"  "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began1017232.6073939833
 But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley338.82627306158577
"  Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment156797.44094982787
 When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish1588.3640118935327
  "Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself180479.32106174863
 Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me211900.92085753728
 How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you72053.97105773281
 She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend194523.30597187523
 But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage459.104247089052
 All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation204.76155655172045
 Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr12870.962386880203
 Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company332219.270613194
 What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way140663.61597220766
"  Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet1095.0221126767615
  As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr2062466.6267424237
 Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"  "I advise Mr7634.831124750402
 Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs4108.948421055075
 Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning638.4380656527494
 It is a nice long walk, and Mr331.4893268794643
 Darcy has never seen the view99.99241919473567
 Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty200879.22689172297
 Wont it, Kitty?"  Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home1434.1494927669908
 Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented2558.5295758368165
 Bennet followed her, saying,  "I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself521264.477266108
 But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then9104651.619493116
 So, do not put yourself to inconvenience336.0959310993667
"  During their walk, it was resolved that Mr742.9717697573885
 Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's191.4836738109319
 She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man1944.4586900419317
 But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr1628724.308210654
 Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation510.2932607045804
         *       *       *       *       *  In the evening, soon after Mr4186.164354835413
 Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme4757.966962586221
 She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr26123413189.246212
 Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile46257.22040413455
" She was gone directly203.4523438670075
  Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious1261.7516874257353
 Darcy18.017419673323744
  "Or in other words, you are determined to have him1460.7947201236475
 But will they make you happy?"  "Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?"  "None at all6074833.026134625
 We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him14032.189478872924
 He is perfectly amiable119.96045240793777
 You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms11273.444661198706
"  "Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent54201.25373791109
 He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask164170.71231206995
 I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him12876.79239982122
 But let me advise you to think better of it692.4643641520688
 I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior1847.8285345072786
 Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage267.7033261738382
 You could scarcely escape discredit and misery95.11349792965333
 My child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life4027.103042690001
 You know not what you are about270.029877497663
"  Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr5104.432125992618
 Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match1962749.962560894
  "Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say3229771.106923392
 If this be the case, he deserves you450.78335582569275
"  To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr189.1602293301041
 Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia126.28006634564737
 He heard her with astonishment87.03410764120183
  "This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the better94774.31349484612
 It will save me a world of trouble and economy119.98179470238212
 Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way4514.177621952542
 I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter53540.241478871205
 Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure3130068.6604652987
"  Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure492502.3135691129
 Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time1353100.026013911
  When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication14376.170915725737
 Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs234.59408092740074
 Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable168.82359643405402
 Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them6016561.839732995
 She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself1062.5528552946919
  "Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr213.81636263871263
 Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all269026.378068544
 I am so pleased--so happy165.01874105499905
 Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before4388.073486432519
 I hope he will overlook it131.43389775058796
 Dear, dear Lizzy226.51450076661197
 A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me15697.40313059852
 I shall go distracted113.47125098371131
"  This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away20632.176420307405
 But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her2985.732995260459
 You must and shall be married by a special licence131.73457942278168
 But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr216.47775831648434
"  This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for1412528.144965724
 But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs281.1783153033484
 Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion460329.69154775643
  Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr5788.336321963786
 Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem2636.4945557567944
  "I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he1334.3389079372557
   Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr295.8447098288212
 "How could you begin?" said she601.1518868859672
 "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"  "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation75335798.20609026
 I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun3424.4197735089474
 Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"  "For the liveliness of your mind, I did14674.176395223378
"  "You may as well call it impertinence at once414.3174334703091
 It was very little less351.7428626792216
 The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention3770.3806661771664
 You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone875.1432436464265
 I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_1340.666457738356
 Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you641223.2204284931
 There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable30316.679091105663
 To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love3948.3493479957065
"  "Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?"  "Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means159010.28590453774
 My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last2161410201.792049
 What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"  "Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement26962202.92918392
"  "But I was embarrassed285.13634447978353
"  "And so was I121.4452524119255
"  "A man who had felt less, might293.6203975758923
"  "How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself56717381.74255378
 I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect16077.11393951692
"  "You need not distress yourself221.83824537696668
 The moral will be perfectly fair98.08289608740274
 Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts628.4239562830409
 I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude280.52003120431715
 My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing7102.590084919483
"  "Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use36288.90860055153
 But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?"  "My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me138015509.99064386
 My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made1476928.5390994085
"  "Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to befall her?"  "I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth343921.0935801131
 But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly237800.75383359424
"  "And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did98900.19665506356
"  From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr124.69312990215641
 Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs504.0520887702143
 Gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:       "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have      done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but      to say the truth, I was too cross to write4618523369123.773
 You supposed more than      really existed96.42568697930136
 But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a      loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible      flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me      actually married, you cannot greatly err42297.55370470635
 You must write again very      soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last3171.6483950323004
 I      thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes11430.416129104495
 How could I      be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful1615.1217744917828
      We will go round the Park every day159.58531115676638
 I am the happiest creature in      the world356.187036900757
 Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one      with such justice969.6202061361436
 I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I      laugh150.10649020150103
 Mr7.688630579355423
 Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can      spare from me7764.3928087456
 You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas538.2654326565175
       Your's, &c53.82955346445866
"  Mr15.772602668744852
 Bennet sent to Mr83.61888795520173
 Collins, in reply to his last239.97207725282766
       "DEAR SIR,       "I must trouble you once more for congratulations3248.9453454083246
 Elizabeth will      soon be the wife of Mr220.00986563536614
 Darcy18.017419673323744
 Console Lady Catherine as well as      you can1499.5307774120772
 But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew7415.860976478587
 He has      more to give98.98654384846328
       "Your's sincerely, &c85.4132292259451
  The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it289.0375951328995
 Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister3649.793166917215
  Before any answer could arrive from Mr104.85979818842956
 The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident239.44018208544944
 Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over8621.096466699333
 At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr4687846.163247646
 Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband419.51479229913144
 He bore it however with admirable calmness191.69960609046018
 If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight16427.749266785133
  Mrs9.62941339842944
 Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs1512.7584449134345
 Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar855330.046384436
 Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant29675.093862182926
 Elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley4747033801934.104
   Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs160.4101312290515
 Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters159.67972141543302
 With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs94.9924417669229
 Bingley and talked of Mrs130.99676800748162
 Darcy may be guessed84.47032726714501
 I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly46745862528.01645
  Mr7.688630579355423
 Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do1643.4126145659986
 Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth135.6568819390205
 So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart29913.81721294948
 The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other114801.0690230223
  Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters2798.932555347492
 She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid29719.665520444087
 From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs1536.450861082404
  Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs5625.809292677661
 Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone94.38745355240219
 Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance73647408.05454172
  As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters1805.684477913419
 He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune4263488.942840356
 The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished42065.602337705284
 The letter was to this effect:       "MY DEAR LIZZY,       "I wish you joy371433.06464757887
 If you love Mr84.93542300267764
 Darcy half as well as I do my dear      Wickham, you must be very happy21406.730070954283
 It is a great comfort to have you      so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will      think of us756781.9976167537
 I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very      much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live      upon without some help181196.05639512764
 Any place would do, of about three or four      hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr41943.311186779145
 Darcy about it,      if you had rather not2260.978079421097
       "Yours, &c56.91311908865893
"  As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind4221.839664126863
 Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them674711.2413422385
 It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills450249.50613836286
 Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme1212.6773334801196
 They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought2244.9350597704297
 His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her155536.28601768977
  Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession4706.328295438396
 Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone633998.8488527058
  Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see7530.932036742107
 They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended3936.3543900705185
 Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother17013.64527599286
 He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry3732.293033184901
 Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way280.61379516565086
 By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself16283.519087912548
  Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end33999775.46180342
 But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city275241217148723.56
  With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms1244.0476928994058
 Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them2829711.266268563
