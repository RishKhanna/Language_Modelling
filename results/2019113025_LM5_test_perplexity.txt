"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs	7789166720144.582
 Bennet made no answer	69479.17640261128


"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently	2.5331583308155302e+17
 Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr	1.9900163688725204e+46
 Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers	1.3654806911295372e+25
"

"I desire you will do no such thing	58594224632.533745
 The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news	3.0400589354931543e+18
 Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr	357783634558.26715
"

"But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs	5.0542058366532815e+25
 Long does not come back
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself	1.4325604506197603e+29
 "Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_	1.9965683298385497e+30

Bingley	99.51115896130685
 I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance	256476337434695.1
 Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball	4954028844.233766



Not all that Mrs	87698.01126226007
 They attacked him
in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour
Lady Lucas	9.571506728110953e+42
 He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party	2.3204018599881193e+29
 Bennet was quite
disconcerted	88525.72415328248


Mr	103.65865118859166
 He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again	2.5445883324751166e+23


Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr	2.314420008822759e+27
 You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner	2623556815700386.0
 Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him	250735510814635.2
 I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance	4.168051009463508e+45
 Mr	103.65865118859166

You never see a fault in any body	496548175.4325375
 They were in fact very fine ladies; not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited	4.021424147548419e+33
 Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty	8.481240234127076e+34

The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	408429671.1647468


Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs	2.1400102630976022e+20
 The
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was Elizabeth's intimate friend	3.184392026806141e+19
--"I certainly saw Mr	66207620.11121724
 Darcy speaking to her	87516.27177480966
"

"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to	1.4727878799208533e+30
 If he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to Mrs	40535729446465.59
"

"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs	628219944949.4707
"

"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you	4.6234792802539056e+26
"

"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him	3.218555464105235e+19
 If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud	3.785540791859466e+16
 Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his
sisters, "I should not care how proud I was	2.6231328967015656e+22
"

"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded	6.1550911453054454e+38
 Mr	103.65865118859166


He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others	2.8659435993826107e+26
 Darcy only can answer	67233.51308251603


Mr	103.65865118859166
--I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies	688048905169589.2
 Darcy bowed	1041.701904207827
"

He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,

"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr	2.3366178471018626e+57


"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away	7.438461759269032e+36
 At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
head quarters	7.197935831569517e+39


After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr	4448823829466.862
 I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced	4485469906743.838
"

"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure	4.1572888914065754e+17
 Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day	2.090101478926412e+25
 Till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance	3.850116970382033e+18
"

Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative	2.7334812859330058e+35
"

"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and
Lydia	4.176663558618566e+17
 Bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer	49177993862.3188
"

"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was
all lost upon me	2.0562684045784935e+23
"

"_You_ observed it, Mr	8546269774.640255
 Mr	103.65865118859166
"

"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and
I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well	1.7671274450169277e+31
"

"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books	4.393645939921064e+18
"

"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place	1.7619516858835943e+20
 They all paint tables, cover skreens and net
purses	98801829705.72675
"

"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading	1.43588666111716e+34

I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_	38276193059.31795
 _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united	4.229477992359139e+22



Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from Mr	7.913800026351189e+36
 The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with	26661554380440.34
 I do not know a place in the country that is
equal to Netherfield	417430268717146.25
 At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here	3868428205818.1006


"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her	3.958548772815909e+17
"

"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home	1.6327354985751615e+32
"

"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing	40157131291194.29
 They have at
least that advantage	6232165.65569944
 Mrs	99.25908788205419


"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for
my part, except the shops and public places	1.407241317967289e+23
"

"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition	63323495020.74217
 He only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true	1.323598685342025e+30
 Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away	6.741114686155878e+30
 But every body is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I
assure you	2.2112315875015717e+22


"Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain	48372043324289.76
 It is what every body says	5601162.210980618
 When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my
brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away	6.5762579029337034e+38
"

"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently	5551326112594.96
 Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required	1.8637534062066897e+24
"

Mrs	1017.6641180120203
"

"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!"

"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours	2.543404762895532e+47
 I shall see her in January	8553167.570147408
 Darcy?"

"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine	2.2476300152502475e+21
"

"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
ease, cannot write ill	2.6217352159751505e+25
 You have shewn him off now much
more than he did himself	3062591158504.163
 We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon	3.094311733501694e+22


"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend	6331648243998.512
"

"Indeed I do not dare	73278281.67313708
--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses	1.0653842741895753e+30
 As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"

"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied	3.295151183320709e+57


"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard	2.2210052286275636e+25
 Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself	6607900504.947433
"

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"No, no; stay where you are	3.1961838908038753e+27
 Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	1.5089960890284923e+19



When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	4.419026475549278e+60

Their powers of conversation were considerable	4907031.698924554
 He addressed
himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr	409151748654809.0

Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr	5348430900.432855
 At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library	inf
 He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book	2.141146763621162e+24
"

Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr	596800622834.2524
--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done	4.0770995888730616e+16
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 But it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule	1.310111266697562e+21
 He owns it
himself without disguise	4726734.059607483
 My
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them	3577786898833.163
"

"_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth	94011479292.57008
--"Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr	5337699876545.471
 Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before	3.790539927101402e+32
 Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home	3.6317828043625316e+23
 Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made	9.759356027621107e+26
 She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself	2.5092181531258096e+23


On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place	2.8329427285799844e+18
--But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle	1.176957810409485e+31


They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to	9.439910218565456e+35
 Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!
Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr	1.1659849275006596e+26
_

     DEAR SIR,

     The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
     breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
     variance	inf
"--My mind however is now made up on
     the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been
     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right
     Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,
     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
     demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be
     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
     instituted by the Church of England	inf
 At present I will not say more, but perhaps
when we are better acquainted----"

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other	4.742653525812316e+35
 The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs	1.8597984063352097e+25
 Lady Catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth	2.6688114041187945e+38
 May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?"

"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible	1.5625097086690989e+68
 But I will no longer importune my young cousin	5014484842.418517



Mr	103.65865118859166


Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	1.2684708262140375e+55

This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part	1.140020923034642e+35
 Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course	3847863340955278.0
 All were struck with the stranger's air,
all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot	7.216974976364448e+60
 Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red	310637036679.6794
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr	2.3410004875040365e+49
 The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits	4.2234953411230664e+16

Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless	2.464615419218866e+20


Mr	103.65865118859166
 Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs	43976774.37865569
 To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long	8.232633550247008e+43
 Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker	6.442624967619507e+79


Mr	103.65865118859166
 At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular	8.780442941665937e+54
 You could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	6.41695612131005e+33
 It is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial	50828110304.20716
 Darcy	101.33262789268478
 I knew it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them	3.967330843408148e+38
 He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me	67556068421.0741

I cannot do justice to his kindness	58271584.376565985
 I can recal nothing worse	713229.4156614861
"

Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them	2.3641738097743805e+18
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 He does not
want abilities	566168.3249616865
"

The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and Mr	4.1147021807895536e+19


"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
living	2.7381894122717117e+18
 Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body	2873245908253.2583
"

"I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think	488257982550.9837
 Mrs	99.25908788205419

Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr	5849526173255.596
 Collins
instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed	47644575566.38369
 No
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for Netherfield were got by proxy	2.5541936308163936e+20



Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in
vain for Mr	31396631253284.555
 Darcy's
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Mr	7.560587952181047e+31
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him	2.0122334305890483e+27
 He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; Charlotte tried to console her	1.0677492707699549e+26
 Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr	1.1774866616191051e+30
 He replied, and was again silent	75258771.27944642
 A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on	2.0891923152620453e+31
 Sir William could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves	1.6065903204864035e+19
"

"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject	2.2574613864455744e+25
 "I am trying to make it out	617028512.5226883
 Darcy's steward	730.7495654701361
 Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr	3.0658920251497442e+25
 Darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way	1.7915977465879313e+53
 Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr	2.697516101273859e+25
 Wickham is by no means a respectable young man	3985666026.68758
 I am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr	2947221392426895.5
 Wickham himself?"

"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton	2.6272534595245645e+17


"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness	2.4544611951319755e+29

I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_	44145873785.11643
 Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance	626235318114.1967
 Bingley	99.51115896130685
"

Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good	1.22805055611745e+34
 I cannot
acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family	1.0434952914017302e+32
 Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family	3.565832293233555e+35
 Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr	1.6029769371207187e+28
 Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs	3761989014.4489455
 Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure	3.860854782828806e+17





CHAPTER XIX	979.1316786136158

Bennet instantly answered,

"Oh dear!--Yes--certainly	69691806.84904549
--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am
sure she can have no objection	2.38079370408536e+17
"

"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr	4980701069919004.0
 Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart	5.536746801668579e+29
 Lizzy declares she will not have Mr	75378954.44995484
"

"And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business	4431795309501439.0
"

"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself	619836871.5686194
"

Mrs	1017.6641180120203
"

Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth	4116398672870.9766


"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs	61087644115.088524
 Those who do not complain are never
pitied	477917965.5094235
 Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball	320705403309402.44
 Bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his	1.9459063153548044e+30
 Bingley will not be detained in London by
them	6265506474.473924
"

"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_	3.2297089590846588e+16

But you do not know _all_	649956956.1247896
"

"That is right	891252.2474630913
 Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses	3.597308777287894e+42
 "It keeps him in good
humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express	3.989856443046345e+24
 This was
very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her
from any return of Mr	9.474298588047498e+29
 Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon	4.4812263161544744e+36
 His
reception however was of the most flattering kind	4590025800.237045
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 The least agreeable
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to
Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person	1.1907724127788713e+28
 Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation	1.4133289059413042e+28


As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs	9.717438122620578e+34
"

Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family	2.8264971062456476e+19
 She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage	5.4350185882814917e+39


Mr	103.65865118859166
 Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away	185648847026630.34
 Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted	1.4721777894889945e+28
 Bennet	101.78305820814953
 On the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband	3796789572634633.0


Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	2.687297144670187e+19


Mrs	99.25908788205419
 As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence	46034174121453.84
 Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"

"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts	3.3653319267709914e+60
"

"What should not you mind?"

"I should not mind any thing at all	3.6611075280453386e+18
"

VOL	1163.3406135801754



Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt	362827170404.9291


Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort	9.035035016448997e+36
 That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations	5.598836091703446e+75
 Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	7.6537201649565e+51
 _I_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it	3.0799538241941606e+18
 Do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will	2.1621088920760646e+21
 Consider Mr	849.8192547743201
 My dear Jane, Mr	845903.6990686336
 Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business	2.849619422134176e+19
"

"Yes, in conjunction with his friend	9067826652.88676
 Why should they try to influence him? They can
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it	9.203451626011298e+28
"

"Your first position is false	71692849.81566668
 But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's	1.780539340257167e+19
 Bingley must be down again in the summer	536295377.575845
 The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr	44255808087617.43


Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr	3.920350479318202e+45
 The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men	4.492220004904482e+52
 Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at
Longbourn	1.8839329123313276e+22

Mrs	99.25908788205419
 He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him	415329294578628.44
"

Mrs	1017.6641180120203
 But do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
anything	4.895222861676803e+34
 Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a
part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr	1.3095203728655792e+29


Mrs	99.25908788205419
 I will try again	69996.04231139972
 At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him	334766129723592.1
 As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,

"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza	1.733376349431457e+22


"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street	2.5426897663945168e+29
 I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner	5462793534.696782
"

Elizabeth shook her head over this letter	480552989.112238
 He knows of my
     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and
     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy	4.320778964977917e+43
 Miss Bingley said something of his never
     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
     with any certainty	2.0023089693434176e+23
 His character sunk on every
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr	6.682534669057918e+33
 There can be no love in all this	591442706.3289489
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
"

"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's
death made her mistress of this fortune	2.4024100704902756e+21
 Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him	4.781174230876025e+28
 She saw instantly that her
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility
was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family	2.981548323278376e+42
 It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit	1.3331347199780172e+32
 She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference	263089183421038.06
 Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	3708134105.5892215
 Collins attending them to point out its
beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much
better worth looking at in the summer	8.69821263141238e+25
--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear	2.8049460733449488e+53
 She enquired into Charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry	2.972593556789445e+56
 Collins, I think	97683.94055133995
 For your
sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line	1.1718492545719274e+29
 But I suppose you had no opportunity	64094360.44900804
 'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure	3995473474854869.0

Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed	49977777328942.72
 Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family	42095847969.35557
 Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty	1.4917153042813631e+41
 Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach	1.336864975415804e+23


In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	322645110355191.9

Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important	1.4242052434480912e+30
 For the last week they had seen very little
of either Lady Catherine or her daughter	2.444748484137449e+16


The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room	1.831698083543985e+20
 It is of all subjects my delight	59346993.48968982


"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady
Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal	1.1117897183588277e+42
 My courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me	48555224725.2689

Darcy, you cannot deny the fact	63061044.888860725
"

"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy,
"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before	2.574144378380595e+28
 They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression	2.6208965855427332e+16
 But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the
trouble of practising	3.4791516030754364e+20
 She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's	4.087815087209569e+17
 Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife	38261263747.11575
 Collins
was settled _near_ her family	523117335.64583856
 The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,

"Are you pleased with Kent?"

A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk	6.065425818919341e+76
 Mr	103.65865118859166


"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone	3.7264652613171315e+19
 All field sports were over	651437.3808545726
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 Collins knew not what to make of him	646808068.4870672





CHAPTER X	741.1941090933697
 Putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,

"I did not know before that you ever walked this way	2.172923405004495e+25
"

"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice	2.0961075664300958e+24

"But so we all do	7617195.924168932
 I think I have heard you say that you know them	535862016240.254
 Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man--he is a great friend of Darcy's	31936220789980.125
 It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case	472204867954896.7
 Bingley for his sister	80326.64979999946
 Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea	2.237946123798446e+20
 Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr	2.1556704465897735e+30
 Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home	1.3441647993590797e+17
 Elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word	6667038683.440844
 After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
agitated manner, and thus began,

"In vain have I struggled	1.6812639528258897e+25
 I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
one	43888239492.55317
 The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
dreadful	54594209.05481976


With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying
that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success	8.138105060030813e+36
 Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself	450232235401.2209
 Wickham	96.30085307271028
 You have
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for
him	3.3818052541297776e+16
 She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr	399740797967685.94
 Darcy, she moved again towards the
gate	527844328.00581646

Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of
sight	2.0502208959465833e+29
--I
     had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
     others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
     young woman in the country	1.3964949884949977e+34
 But amidst
     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to
     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to
     the sense and disposition of both	4.4082455431026554e+67
--The part which I acted, is now to be explained	44264710677746.805
--I described, and
     enforced them earnestly	6281440264.326964
 He had before believed her to return his
     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard	2.6617917474699766e+17
--That they might have met without ill consequence, is
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger	8.407875814300469e+30
--It is done, however,
     and it was done for the best	5639264064322880.0
 My father was not
     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always
     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it	2.5655931378172343e+42

     But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr	530892502.4514605
 He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein	1.1156872808119892e+32
 He resigned all
     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
     thousand pounds	7.980104161398134e+31
 I
     must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
     me to unfold to any human being	7.217407533857492e+30
 But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate	4.4956387268348965e+45
 She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance	2.818673436640757e+45
 She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before	2.5141150546691787e+23
 That had
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr	3.7408676320301234e+43


She grew absolutely ashamed of herself	5081886.354412692
 It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that
Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before	5.7586336018916656e+66
 To Rosings he then
hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her	2.793678484891746e+52
--"I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as I do	1.277244003663996e+31
"

Lady Catherine seemed resigned	571264.2652817701
"

"Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things	3.245525104636025e+21
 Where shall you change
horses?--Oh! Bromley, of course	61981363672.82804
 Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing	7.861200045614432e+67
 They were ignorant, idle, and vain	635770807.6774479

Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost	2.2018853563731555e+21
 How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family!

When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	inf
 You see how continually we are engaged there	412751268.8232929
"

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable	6.48755763938478e+52
"

"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him	5055727436216779.0
 I will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her	3920198070737.5425
 Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs	5777966136659.861
 Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, Mrs	2.9469799717075994e+17
 Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name	2.8762732613476233e+19
 Bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	1.7991089978838773e+66


"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too	inf
 But I confess they would have no charms
for _me_	3865300216101.81
 I should infinitely prefer a book	4912750.185423934
 There was
another reason too for her opposition	463979706.96444744
 She was
sorry that Mr	822556.56101305
 "You never will be able to make both
of them good for any thing	3674704281475726.0
 For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr	4953636830951.855
 One may be continually
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty	7.472397104602557e+27
"

"You are quite right	7428917.854468545
 There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say	32920148025844.42
 The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments	1.0481151339465161e+24
 Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described	55492381552221.45


"I cannot see why Mrs	6382194.961640437
 In this danger Kitty
is also comprehended	41931286.64539935
 Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love	1.1300145983214089e+30
 At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here	1.6620768491903764e+18
 The officers will find
women better worth their notice	2995704190.768595
"

With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry	2.0687583497818056e+26


Elizabeth was now to see Mr	7801141.205258219
 She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary	2.8741257321419645e+26
 Darcy's having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	1.5131445997675997e+19
 Her answer was warmly in his favour	57177537.55515575
"

"And you saw him frequently?"

"Yes, almost every day	4683198976054467.0
"

"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth	8295845883.297369
"

Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head	2.843800457122091e+21

Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard	1.1068627291547025e+71





CHAPTER XIX	979.1316786136158



Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort	7.826918988199771e+25
 This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given	3.6000129924978e+39


Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough	1.0623451078748085e+24


The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement	1.1310497958331073e+23


Mrs	99.25908788205419
 They have some of the finest woods in the
country	64096367526.6913
"

Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce	70642115218.2302


Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer	4.6900285364794723e+42


By the Author of "Sense and Sensibility	593922570.1494851
"

VOL	1163.3406135801754


The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her	2.4542299450851423e+26
 Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it	3594563414102696.5
 Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
"is my master--and very like him	4.161699979342909e+16
 Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master	3540542768120546.5
"

This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr	94717275.34606689


"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"

"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months	2.5636568241558888e+47
 I do not know who is
good enough for him	48400827817.9094


"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs	568363577284.8695
"

"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth	3121118929743616.5
"

"That is not very likely; our authority was too good	39928810793086.945
"

On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room, when last at Pemberley	2.1863665523393556e+59
 Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it	3.603032221464563e+18
 They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family	3.607191303543807e+41
 The walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met	1.9071665237534697e+20
 Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them	8.068751705011609e+32

This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself	7.643814208454037e+46
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling	59816834.49393902
 Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy	9.36072418765923e+32
 The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention	3798114699415.0566


In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
like manner	1.3433857432626585e+33
 When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible	inf


Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose
to depart, Mr	1.9208789190166474e+18
 and Mrs	1028.4885580875994
 Presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on	3.123530114065954e+56
 They
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit	9.5033845471212e+37


As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out	2.1753523807950856e+56
 They were, therefore, to go	92931361.88064122
 There was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table	1.424811238748082e+40
 Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning	8.514829647488259e+39
 Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family	1.8537501502011683e+55
 While
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes	5.700389660289108e+33


Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more	4.180166878298329e+42
 Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully	4.999674213877051e+44
 When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister	2.0449270486996858e+26
 Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer	4.141584256227557e+32
"

He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself	1.1814136791938572e+29
 His choice is disinterested at least,
     for he must know my father can give her nothing	2.972633002920068e+17
 Lydia left a few lines for his wife,
     informing her of their intention	364317593859673.56
 I am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but I hardly know what I have written	2.462638190880026e+21
"

Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first	2.330028459682653e+50

     Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express	1.6419044685163264e+18
 came on into
     Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
     the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such
     people had been seen to pass through	2.1629689968436012e+36
 F	89.99626846496759
 My father and mother believe the worst,
     but I cannot think so ill of him	3.374673595156371e+16
 My poor mother is really ill
     and keeps her room	44845554114.60527
 Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home, instantly	1.4134288442855058e+32
"

"No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself	5.28767579745544e+16
"

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word	1.8571633461071152e+21
 At length, she spoke again	6887878.7357223695
 They are gone off together
from Brighton	41855260.48842938
 "When I consider," she added, in a yet
more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew
what he was	1.8648216406873427e+31
 Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it	575906458.3311125


If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty	1.1380309814653891e+20
 For such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey	9.09820009174111e+53
 "But what is to be
done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs	42019612681445.234

Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn	4.786173616825634e+55
"

"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road	1.0117999027366718e+35
"

"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely	8.821269754130034e+30
 But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good	2860251088041913.5
"

"And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs	50135456617791.49
 From
what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl	2.9412717666723724e+21
 Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself	4404474666124480.5
"

"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other	2.689823388000769e+26
 Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing	3.5844540128422684e+67


Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject	inf
 Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them	2.340052360815967e+19
 His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost	5349866923.351782
 I should never be happy without
     him, so think it no harm to be off	3.3298926216781388e+16
 You need not send them word at
     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia
     Wickham	8.353646742976307e+39
 Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you
     will drink to our good journey	2.4316142736747332e+16
"

"Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you	48131006416708.13
 You do not look
well	726026.4192145073

Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on	2.6859919977784957e+23
 Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied	3480688075144.421
"

She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter	1.4036929752041582e+27
 His principal object must be, to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham	2.10968769692999e+19
 Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him	2.0688006416948496e+17

Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	307091069810.3696
 Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel	1.3098133920930256e+36


Mr	103.65865118859166
 Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr	3.6133466494203784e+16
 Howsoever that may be, you
     are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined
     by Mrs	4.7217101520067986e+22


"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away	1.9917595175467823e+66
"

"Well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?"

"What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it	6.743114208841354e+45

     If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will
     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement	5.0669936341804386e+39


"Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately	4.05030637794946e+18

Consider how important every moment is, in such a case	386821540795.05164


"And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with	4.392683581915307e+22
"

"Money! my uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir?"

"I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone	1.618265017950006e+52
 "How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
thankful	3.3311826975502972e+16
 He has
children of his own, and may have more	595018898327.2329
 Bennet could hardly
contain herself	548572.4882987709
 How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly	7.719025012872521e+31
 Mrs	99.25908788205419
 We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately	1.5470966757519462e+18
 An
airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure	435573523825736.94
"

Mrs	1017.6641180120203


When first Mr	8287.512925958232
 This was one point, with
regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr	4.105574114947945e+21
 Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him	4696601694922.368
 He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,
through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within
that sum	3.809890236969964e+55
 I will not encourage
the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn	323464319917162.1
 Bennet could hardly comprehend
it	621208.3534669854
 She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence	2.787760477758513e+16
 But while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph	613607819114.7324
 It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance	4.029479326780492e+51
"

His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative	5.653893465784833e+33
 Smiles decked the face of Mrs	7111434.545854824
 Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was
shocked	51690899420.25674
 Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the
people here abouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might
not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was
determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like
any thing	inf
"

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first	1.7335354018498351e+25
 Wickham," by
each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her
ring and boast of being married, to Mrs	1.795068279616979e+30
"

"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands	1.6014269108136296e+28


Lydia was exceedingly fond of him	5937241.941469216
 I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"

"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
subject	9.80648095424599e+39
 It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go	2.2702278044535964e+24



Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as
soon as she possibly could	3.2420709336175693e+18
 6	87.50575375003223


     "MY DEAR NIECE,

     "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will
     not comprise what I have to tell you	1.6207818181148928e+41

     Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,
     that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
     side	1.0241119276944535e+31
 At length, however, our
     kind friend procured the wished-for direction	3699396290513.8906
 They were in ----
     street	534902306.2946365
 But he found, in reply to
     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country	9.728950276015477e+28
 When all this was resolved
     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more
     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
     receive the last finish	1.5118017056724332e+49
 _He_ was
     exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I
     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
     while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter
     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no
     fresh pain	3.3757673682019043e+77
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 Darcy was
     punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the
     wedding	3.623543136875812e+16

     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
     wife may teach him	1.0583583948626067e+34
 It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return	1.5761586149600317e+23
 They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing
to him	476097888815685.0


"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he,
as he joined her	2.5715692336225257e+22
 When I last saw her, she was not very promising	564468481158.4498
 Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember	3.548957041617272e+21
"

"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation	5407334653473.179
 You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it	3.117975350742021e+17





CHAPTER XI	744.2447302579417
"

Mr	1062.5139163277404
"

In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it	1.2282773743258672e+35
"

His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield	1.4080246371356147e+25


"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he	517999941144.94885
 Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr	2.6110966422314887e+24
 On the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance	2.6556537409029064e+34


Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied	4.847000444988736e+36
 She was disappointed,
and angry with herself for being so	530845679740.68805
 A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away	377368292282329.2


"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr	3.472480886517946e+31
 His regiment is there; for I suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars	1.7616566067218022e+29
 Bingley," said her mother,
"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr	3.0328096445799507e+25


"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
in company with either of them	3.5573915005523034e+26
 Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time	2.0677916628784655e+23
 They then went away	67517.08505372709
"

"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now	3.534204343452214e+19
"

       *       *       *       *       *

They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs	1.6656846666616192e+18
 Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived	1.5981068437181122e+34
 Mr	103.65865118859166
"

"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"

"Mrs	4.284789819544041e+16
 Long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously	7.663045233011107e+26


"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth	5105001063224397.0
 It mortifies me	10133.678032966245
"

He should be particularly happy at any time, &c	3726434188475.434
 Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown	4.763912603989746e+18
 Bennet half opened the door and called out,

"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you	3.151347909318381e+21


"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall	2.0816361665960517e+24


After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference	493384364624.2212
 Bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on	431693307999.0392
 The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected	36775083629.601135
 I do not deserve it	754390.6247992609
 Oh!
why is not every body as happy?"

Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express	5.81001062500249e+30


"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried	5105523697545.456
 At that moment, she cared for no other	5762911557.121144


Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept	9.893000449573464e+53
"

"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth	74638113384.34787
 Collins in time	8695.015549277678
 As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery	9.717875646180466e+34


Mrs	99.25908788205419
"

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was	841996512.4152088
"

"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence	2.4674086248810747e+18
"

Mrs	1017.6641180120203
 I saw them the night before last	58064780.64324303
"

Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	5676789.825871618
 I was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr	9.057660407363401e+48
 Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you	3.9601898109422236e+47
"

"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth,
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence	1.789112433159236e+39
 _You_
may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer	2.9928504749605164e+16
 I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns	1.7218864063747578e+21
 Mr	103.65865118859166
 It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of her's	4.5026134023786104e+16
 If Mr	947.7396695653963
 I shall not go away, till you have given me the
assurance I require	3145163121064734.5
"

"And I certainly _never_ shall give it	606212510168.5842
"

Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself	1.310922199091061e+24

She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you	1.5738262069743423e+25





CHAPTER XV	736.8373587685448
 Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way	1.276866135778334e+24
 As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents	3171871462266.3105
 Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer	1.2545819860929208e+30
 I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned	5.563447057824353e+43
 You ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing	1.0983426595489108e+29
 It was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried	4786396180068.646
 It was agreed to	89068.87726415285
 I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister	2497008918399897.0
"

"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness	1.0299301379626223e+41


"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before	3.1276520351030854e+22
"

"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof	1.7132897570571233e+41
"

"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself	67799287992.57085
"

"I can easily believe it	70896816.50410967
"

"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so	5.1538296470412736e+17
 _Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance	1.4802276394976815e+32
 By you, I was properly humbled	69854132.18583554
 He has heartily forgiven me
now	6106997.156874151
 I speak nothing but the truth	6607689.655646905
 It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world	2.587441055564741e+18
 I want to talk very seriously	5871171.502768598
 Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"

"I advise Mr	2.1902126167027343e+23
 Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs	904705246181.2429
 It is a nice long walk, and Mr	6232520858.956429


"Or in other words, you are determined to have him	5716003780475.157
 He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane	2.3685618636005582e+20
 He is perfectly amiable	69657.35650016525
 You know not what you are
about	66312445.91316225
 Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia	5413299.725230831


"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission! So much the better	6.922838017937916e+41
"

Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure	4.422759943424167e+34
 I
hope he will overlook it	6437389.296681246
 Dear, dear Lizzy	82542.08647727285
 "Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane's	1.7792404795242408e+24
 "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"

"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation	3.023885608660253e+52


The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
as sincere as her brother's in sending it	1.787177825756669e+20


As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters	3.2040688567189504e+17
 Darcy about it,
     if you had rather not	6767644509.979221
 His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her	4.777172120808437e+37


Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth	1.9787355865891147e+54
 Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way	3051136770579.8936
