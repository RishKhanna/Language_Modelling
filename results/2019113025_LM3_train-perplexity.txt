  Title: Ulysses  Author: James Joyce  Release Date: December 27, 2001 [eBook #4300] [Most recently updated: December 27, 2019]  Language: English  Character set encoding: UTF-8  Produced by: Col Choat and David Widger  *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ULYSSES ***  [Illustration]     Ulysses   by James Joyce   Contents   — I —   [ 1 ]  [ 2 ]  [ 3 ]   — II —   [ 4 ]  [ 5 ]  [ 6 ]  [ 7 ]  [ 8 ]  [ 9 ]  [ 10 ]  [ 11 ]  [ 12 ]  [ 13 ]  [ 14 ]  [ 15 ]   — III —   [ 16 ]  [ 17 ]  [ 18 ]     — I —   [ 1 ]  Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed202951822348.9317
 A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air673.2762359273769
 He held the bowl aloft and intoned:  —_Introibo ad altare Dei_1387.7396253479153
  Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:  —Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!  Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest8345.234950987102
 He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains530.7428947006208
 Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head32118.611658713533
 Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak71839.84591009365
  Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly315.57082528006634
  —Back to barracks! he said sternly830.5687145644122
  He added in a preacher’s tone:  —For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns4550.373617029902
 Slow music, please205.57493996109295
 Shut your eyes, gents180.08433730403945
 A little trouble about those white corpuscles187.642705618402
 Silence, all180.3119483627637
  He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points4140.8032643495735
 Chrysostomos165.11363440604825
 Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm195.84467036738272
  —Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly706.7809077573461
 That will do nicely249.95493743806338
 Switch off the current, will you?  He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown7024.567335174155
 The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages1196.7291850658005
 A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips189.08333620404494
  —The mockery of it! he said gaily1134.409379321824
 Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!  He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself8265.964682112804
 Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck44349.69030047309
  Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on191.93565107851543
  —My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls870.243992534597
 But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn’t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself317.91659344981434
 We must go to Athens186.57132836942
 Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?  He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:  —Will he come? The jejune jesuit!  Ceasing, he began to shave with care204978.79339467717
  —Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly5303.125133711669
  —Yes, my love?  —How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?  Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder14071.470470273945
  —God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly1017.4603116727804
 A ponderous Saxon162.99867224766606
 He thinks you’re not a gentleman223.01370517637727
 God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion299.4052185574416
 Because he comes from Oxford259.19545685500896
 You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner3790.3337648866654
 He can’t make you out204.97518660371713
 O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade3221.015592343562
  He shaved warily over his chin201.15109871554026
  —He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said723.6892984814701
 Where is his guncase?  —A woful lunatic! Mulligan said427.39887681907
 Were you in a funk?  —I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear51201.585414096575
 Out here in the dark with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther19760.126755309342
 You saved men from drowning246.85255974390216
 I’m not a hero, however365.83299707549935
 If he stays on here I am off300.5990163040115
  Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade455.18917240737164
 He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily603.439436647473
  —Scutter! he cried thickly397.33948590620986
  He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper pocket, said:  —Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor24110.300769147198
  Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief1248.4710468789117
 Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly160.56625446662719
 Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:  —The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen183223.4252198392
 You can almost taste it, can’t you?  He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly5761.875247969134
  —God! he said quietly820.24411340447
 Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother? The snotgreen sea703.4006209005458
 The scrotumtightening sea155.47186690131988
 _Epi oinopa ponton_311.1134341690245
 Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you533.8449021211752
 You must read them in the original639.2032949007245
 _Thalatta! Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother1101.8138240055266
 Come and look188.8680362451551
  Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet1937.5673902446736
 Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown28342.25577772994
  —Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said406.76613382356624
  He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s face955.2043118043255
  —The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said433.6522539531899
  —Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily2139.6236402076297
  —You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said4010.5823100731227
 I’m hyperborean as much as you653.65327312738
 But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her7115.3733999322
 And you refused156.02638489807006
 There is something sinister in you186.40596757956706

5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
  He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek199.32765908604682
 A tolerant smile curled his lips170.32956797768693
  —But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself257.87381148402886
  Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve5761.101969493423
 Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart3287.399749891439
 Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes92122.66837241578
 Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him3524.236418036214
 The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid472.7121214254635
 A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting1920.8697464369852
  Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade170.14820424829028
  —Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice3510.6022720479864
 I must give you a shirt and a few noserags872.7301977594359
 How are the secondhand breeks?  —They fit well enough, Stephen answered896.8931020163787
  Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip207.17425257262292
  —The mockery of it, he said contentedly8731.87655142977
 Secondleg they should be198.94449921992276
 God knows what poxy bowsy left them off272.6544230008279
 I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey347.05952051109375
 You’ll look spiffing in them176.1568417714817
 I’m not joking, Kinch167.64880233626934
 You look damn well when you’re dressed212.17973933168255
  —Thanks, Stephen said273.89053247905713
 I can’t wear them if they are grey457.5531724939262
  —He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror11357.493946691697
 Etiquette is etiquette171.56701680071254
 He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers378.6103342312953
  He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin251.8360556288407
  Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes7784.205491140824
  —That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g8507.855717714097
 p21.29545135188944
 i36.83187796061835
 He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman184.5718369489451
 General paralysis of the insane!  He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea2795.3369035988835
 His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth371.3968259912081
 Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk184.86969847490565
  —Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!  Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack238278.5654736173
 Hair on end179.71596982127267
 As he and others see me296.76790881249326
 Who chose this face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin547.414341880902
 It asks me too180.36715363366807
  —I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said6610.589281546093
 It does her all right185.44237116912447
 The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi170.33733180312814
 Lead him not into temptation200.16483184938429
 And her name is Ursula272.66167645299066
  Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes1128.610388046013
  —The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said1008.4076075424208
 If Wilde were only alive to see you!  Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:  —It is a symbol of Irish art170591.35818423258
 The cracked lookingglass of a servant231.79183633839938
  Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them4318.027661553578
  —It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly104645.99951303468
 God knows you have more spirit than any of them361.06545988438427
  Parried again166.2006361681881
 He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his418.5535252143782
 The cold steel pen221.14183279805584
  —Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea4535.755684568205
 He’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman369.8982176523286
 His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other533.25472691706
 God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island19432.592960911432
 Hellenise it166.81873996541566
  Cranly’s arm155.23699870602863
 His arm148.97254334928402
  —And to think of your having to beg from these swine1183.4569053577036
 I’m the only one that knows what you are323.0309005560688
 Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe28170.78116304094
  Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms179.1247513012398
 Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another257.86692321319066
 O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor’s shears16819.006771360193
 A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade166.02028056215514
 I don’t want to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!  Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle5184.967184252907
 A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms431.66568278819653
  To ourselves155.96681136495286

 omphalos165.8128159860159
  —Let him stay, Stephen said300.08281980673934
 There’s nothing wrong with him except at night368.9390403599774
  —Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently3734.712339722352
 I’m quite frank with you176.7396250439508
 What have you against me now?  They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale10166.406152068128
 Stephen freed his arm quietly183.83098670929593
  —Do you wish me to tell you? he asked2211.9960278404815
  —Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered6519.524626411027
 I don’t remember anything221.51164364343336
 A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes892.2071361465022
  Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:  —Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s death?  Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:  —What? Where? I can’t remember anything196982743.48251405
 I remember only ideas and sensations176.0946132432314
 Why? What happened in the name of God?  —You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water201255.31991430398
 Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom3657.29025501381
 She asked you who was in your room581.7902499034351
  —Yes? Buck Mulligan said393.25786306938625
 What did I say? I forget544.6250060335055
  —You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead5638.256751416141
_  A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan’s cheek409.3697056605408
  —Did I say that? he asked1123.2652095688857
 Well? What harm is that?  He shook his constraint from him nervously2089.1696187674556
  —And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You saw only your mother die2698.805996940107
 I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom1300.6590172785986
 It’s a beastly thing and nothing else200.4477559657917
 It simply doesn’t matter187.459156591578
 You wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you1372.916530557079
 Why? Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected the wrong way1198.226287172656
 To me it’s all a mockery and beastly289.09897252120015
 Her cerebral lobes are not functioning176.4473225944302
 She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt246.13177575897555
 Humour her till it’s over179.69095315155738
 You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette’s484.4722776295398
 Absurd! I suppose I did say it445.22654593543115
 I didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother794.2307853240869
  He had spoken himself into boldness174.61424624173105
 Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:  —I am not thinking of the offence to my mother69908.09158880715
  —Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked792.6057691770858
  —Of the offence to me, Stephen answered1316.3764286048463
  Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel208.4363530633396
  —O, an impossible person! he exclaimed353.37343856354255
  He walked off quickly round the parapet199.89388122777933
 Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland438.5952052761738
 Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks20284.960775566637
  A voice within the tower called loudly:  —Are you up there, Mulligan?  —I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered29843.837093501694
  He turned towards Stephen and said:  —Look at the sea6920.557457806421
 What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down938.3252324451341
 The Sassenach wants his morning rashers164.65296422888085
  His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof:  —Don’t mope over it all day, he said107209.00305563571
 I’m inconsequent154.39699533388975
 Give up the moody brooding182.96813343546845
  His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead:       And no more turn aside and brood      Upon love’s bitter mystery      For Fergus rules the brazen cars27708.253705906583
  Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed469.4298389968711
 Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet416.14505211557656
 White breast of the dim sea193.597017076639
 The twining stresses, two by two199.02517265809223
 Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide211.0257304906488
  A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green334.9942713730841
 It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters905.9377112842425
 Fergus’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords3189.7114429016683
 Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music567.3630442969703
 Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside728.4691088427764
 She was crying in her wretched bed190.72597977997268
 For those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery452.18420223036355
  Where now?  Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer339.32473890121446
 A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl6921.139008924404
 She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:       I am the boy      That can enjoy      Invisibility15162.176511315514
  Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed209.6397480311787
       And no more turn aside and brood161.6622707495659
   Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys1138.7123807758633
 Memories beset his brooding brain174.633681863262
 Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament950.7311742937324
 A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening668.3553206113163
 Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts571.3976743035402
  In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes118027.99107392105
  Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul812.6895855047829
 On me alone188.0488714396565
 The ghostcandle to light her agony175.0745503660066
 Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees522.0947012325587
 Her eyes on me to strike me down368.1679083765427
 _Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat506.3856488343169
_  Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!  No, mother! Let me be and let me live2774.5607217654833
  —Kinch ahoy!  Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower744.9760618694877
 It came nearer up the staircase, calling again750.0590462927968
 Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words7494.610094080916
  —Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey1594.3844712491511
 Breakfast is ready170.8774518343728
 Haines is apologising for waking us last night186.18870365220414
 It’s all right83.13615453311431
  —I’m coming, Stephen said, turning3066.1045669837154
  —Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said542.1102456807199
 For my sake and for all our sakes451.87972482376665
  —I told him your symbol of Irish art666.1379621076419
 He says it’s very clever178.5423263443247
  —I get paid this morning, Stephen said693.6103101580023
  —The school kip? Buck Mulligan said377.5079389030271
 How much? Four quid? Lend us one279.9103448609629
  —If you want it, Stephen said551.0917679543959
  —Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight1496.904754531659
 We’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids211.04976766351876
 Four omnipotent sovereigns153.60203531653562
  He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent:       O, won’t we have a merry time,      Drinking whisky, beer and wine!      On coronation,      Coronation day!      O, won’t we have a merry time      On coronation day!  Warm sunshine merrying over the sea1067148.1201705143
 The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet1377.1230792776212
 Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?  He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck793040.4938632966
 So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes236.6902447822179
 I am another now and yet the same235.22706335030873
 A servant too168.2478228339723
 A server of a servant233.05008501506435
 Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning7643.891068252848
  —We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said252.71088741218523
 Haines, open that door, will you?  Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker2053.86993186959
 A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors11830.493799820997
  —Have you the key? a voice asked1364.8004754611043
  —Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said643.4455264075659
 Janey Mack, I’m choked!  He howled, without looking up from the fire:  —Kinch!  —It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward285466.4564854399
  The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered2994.8555294384123
 Haines stood at the doorway, looking out795.9570944003934
 Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait5998.456570286893
 Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him1397.790471259192
 Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief25664.21985815404
  —I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when13812.34838742698
5.2325521685823055
 But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey1827.1291728723882
 Haines, come in167.72015665898235
 The grub is ready158.97683429179708
 Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts732.0955133465347
 Where’s the sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk866.19217708767
  Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker500.21442952397655
 Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet439.0678683540254
  —What sort of a kip is this? he said1909.9007267021298
  —We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily2159.55451598126
 There’s a lemon in the locker184.67245217719108
  —O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said492.42773809410465
 I want Sandycove milk162.46294110718247
  Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:  —That woman is coming up with the milk14174.990218238714
 Sit down156.31593703542677
 Pour out the tea there272.75647713753324
 The sugar is in the bag815.2477460960567
 Here, I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs320.0577305851475
  He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying:  —_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti44581.43425520345
_  Haines sat down to pour out the tea881.1051743951938
  —I’m giving you two lumps each, he said326.0628123490141
 But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don’t you?  Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s wheedling voice:  —When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said12082930.98778929
 And when I makes water I makes water617.0941833119549
  —By Jove, it is tea, Haines said2266.421018456668
  Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:  —_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she12017.527608393888
 _Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don’t make them in the one pot28632.512210991328
  —That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines10321.67606721762
 Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum298.3549337908224
 Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind1735.7401746639
  He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows:  —Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?  —I doubt it, said Stephen gravely1917313.9316835962
  —Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone24795.70637551598
 Your reasons, pray?  —I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion519123.0003960333
 Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann402.5346830539409
  —Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly2421.1033947899255
 Do you think she was? Quite charming!  Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:  _—For old Mary Ann  She doesn’t care a damn17742.162841370704
  But, hising up her petticoats171.10588834435566
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
_  He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned304.61986725840825
  The doorway was darkened by an entering form204.2239051308603
  —The milk, sir!  —Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said5213.159966086527
 Kinch, get the jug226.24680208995574
  An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow991.1225246069648
 Glory be to God197.26470079398564
  —To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her1639.5271072298751
 Ah, to be sure!  Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker1614.863347220388
  —The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces1925.380225675362
  —How much, sir? asked the old woman3677.6012112451376
  —A quart, Stephen said403.7752250868387
  He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers337.91847146240553
 She poured again a measureful and a tilly190.90178662691562
 She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out527.3034883012286
 Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs506.4729696651722
 They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle333.0683740315922
 Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times1256.5524651609335
 A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning451.573473114662
 To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour832.8097418917637
  —It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups3031.7922184907943
  —Taste it, sir, she said1613.3343125799697
  He drank at her bidding169.9509033418649
  —If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts132801.30859426872
 Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits323.2986485055815
  —Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked3140.2923151131845
  —I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered2023.34205989005
  —Look at that now, she said811.7581409214059
  Stephen listened in scornful silence175.14412569780094
 She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights759.0448208419792
 To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey2572.6415576882587
 And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes556.8313892213571
  —Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her1189.0004671704253
  —Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines5751.747511901773
  Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently515.6210794039362
  —Irish, Buck Mulligan said283.9055534598799
 Is there Gaelic on you?  —I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it3411738.9515993
 Are you from the west, sir?  —I am an Englishman, Haines answered89172.83685491333
  —He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland54519.73948585926
  —Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the language myself42875.664754143196
 I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows260.66487868029316
  —Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan632.8126038141174
 Wonderful entirely152.52284893408915
 Fill us out some more tea, Kinch243.962277763332
 Would you like a cup, ma’am?  —No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go3786501.4557365403
  Haines said to her:  —Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?  Stephen filled again the three cups36574.28293126478
  —Bill, sir? she said, halting4836.593406870132
 Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling1909.676103629314
 That’s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir1673.2113817180712
  Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets6056.925182688069
  —Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling13472.180977805669
  Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk344.7944922503893
 Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried:  —A miracle!  He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:  —Ask nothing more of me, sweet2409822.1836029766
 All I can give you I give737.9947764221732
  Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand315.29349919028886
  —We’ll owe twopence, he said240.0939550451236
  —Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin19723.739256953537
 Good morning, sir241.0901988899694
  She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:  _—Heart of my heart, were it more,  More would be laid at your feet36605.57323099483
_  He turned to Stephen and said:  —Seriously, Dedalus2710.108779907797
 I’m stony155.16156327697544
 Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money380.72129774079804
 Today the bards must drink and junket258.2171345982188
 Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty353.6547413176318
  —That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today29828.222850249138
  —Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said268.1853241443784
  He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:  —Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?  Then he said to Haines:  —The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month364933.9624600326
  —All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf8695.1117870594
  Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:  —I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me107056.28281371706
  Speaking to me230.45458498681202
 They wash and tub and scrub179.0043077949187
 Agenbite of inwit103.02502840792432
 Conscience165.45887532660248
 Yet here’s a spot167.01792157466397
  —That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good1852.8992168151237
  Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone:  —Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines16594.856732310698
  —Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen13160.822117715259
 I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in1035.8994249746765
  —Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked305.1323466766986
  Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said:  —I don’t know, I’m sure1098962.1526683317
  He strolled out to the doorway500.6465441583898
 Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour:  —You put your hoof in it now8563.329889878194
 What did you say that for?  —Well? Stephen said4287.497329218543
 From whom? From the milkwoman or from him255.23632223321434
 It’s a toss up, I think340.5627345909296
  —I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes64699.53101135531
  —I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him3004.1045452306707
  Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm682.3779291389765
  —From me, Kinch, he said1833.1754195306282
  In a suddenly changed tone he added:  —To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right6704.642532490152
 Damn all else they are good for316.0677795315484
 Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all1884.8217873326878
 Let us get out of the kip3475.4254721938637
  He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly:  —Mulligan is stripped of his garments1710.1681007702427
  He emptied his pockets on to the table541.2777678919249
  —There’s your snotrag, he said336.58678200576867
 His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief301.2161554188696
 God, we’ll simply have to dress the character246.7181683916893
 I want puce gloves and green boots183.4827768024503
 Contradiction165.11363440604825
 Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself751.5760147526935
 Mercurial Malachi174.70891854038152
 A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands1043.237235218578
  —And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said541.8643308212424
  Stephen picked it up and put it on1672.5304053527275
 Haines called to them from the doorway:  —Are you coming, you fellows?  —I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door128888.21802618683
 Come out, Kinch187.33041460285472
 You have eaten all we left, I suppose254.54775135471905
 Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:  —And going forth he met Butterly3983.766061258371
  Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it29225.27488727433
 He put the huge key in his inner pocket311.7661104015524
  At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:  —Did you bring the key?  —I have it, Stephen said, preceding them15377956.141494956
  He walked on110.79943651566413
 Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses364.02376293391467
  —Down, sir! How dare you, sir!  Haines asked:  —Do you pay rent for this tower?  —Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said232137.26351565862
  —To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder637.5608219219636
  They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:  —Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say927.2181410338346
 Martello you call it?  —Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea259105.89829422082
 But ours is the _omphalos_244.5531375622532
  —What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen596.1082628665448
  —No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain5398.259916224183
 I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up472.16319728913743
 Wait till I have a few pints in me first1314.893186855868
  He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat:  —You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?  —It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer31756566.692295417
  —You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably659.5419415427685
 Is it some paradox?  —Pooh! Buck Mulligan said306.21215917525285
 We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes196.17799917998397
 It’s quite simple162.51120401997795
 He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father3170.911000331109
  —What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen2628.0454431083
 He himself?  Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:  —O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!  —We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines31995271.551834073
 And it is rather long to tell430.41573220389796
  Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands1029.903761095469
  —The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said366.9591327984767
  —I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore4141.712734469082
 _That beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?  Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak78462.84950879563
 In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires421.0019924980702
  —It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again1437.6219335986934
  Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent416.01203848989434
 The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins1528.1663264403976
  —I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused5310.208776842196
 The Son striving to be atoned with the Father257.310647721217
  Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face242.72607359200111
 He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety43316.004130770634
 He moved a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:  _—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard120414.23952508852
 My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird685.4887019196194
 With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree307.0643065149283
 So here’s to disciples and Calvary172.09752304785303
_  He held up a forefinger of warning335.0248975283028
  _—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again1045.8802330363744
_  He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:  _—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead4159675.4959328645
 What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet’s breezy456.51045615322096
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
 Goodbye, now, goodbye!_  He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries8904.37469120548
  Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said:  —We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose22286.815563910233
 He’s rather blasphemous158.20630776687872
 I’m not a believer myself, that is to say1091.8134387291925
 Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?  —The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered358628.10018263484
  —O, Haines said, you have heard it before?  —Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily416118.8343169546
  —You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked3067.105132745888
 I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word975.476243682861
 Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God216.56651688065133
  —There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said10822.02539078568
  Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone321.6501722327916
 He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it805.9422996934273
  —Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette6716.865419415518
  Haines helped himself and snapped the case to307.8018779372301
 He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands85764.20788243294
  —Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again141274.53809997233
 Either you believe or you don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal God1203.4338405016688
 You don’t stand for that, I suppose?  —You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought292539.0154824558
  He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side1081.1980847381437
 Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels634.654299101907
 My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path498.966242806257
 They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark666.1663035412608
 He wants that key167.86379553516667
 It is mine159.757707562528
 I paid the rent176.1557506123817
 Now I eat his salt bread171.3370464170429
 Give him the key too447.5571311316614
 All98.80265906741536
 He will ask for it186.59621308298682
 That was in his eyes685.8806823059782
  —After all, Haines began279.2474328965085
5.2325521685823055
  —After all, I should think you are able to free yourself893.9313086405954
 You are your own master, it seems to me644.9452736287478
  —I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian10459.733131555602
  —Italian? Haines said199.53369375219876
  A crazy queen, old and jealous211.09465473643442
 Kneel down before me201.56973259581343
  —And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs5691.632922254419
  —Italian? Haines said again222.87269992189294
 What do you mean?  —The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church172154.30365534397
  Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke278.7032847848524
  —I can quite understand that, he said calmly5965.98999443154
 An Irishman must think like that, I daresay1591.726561594405
 We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly359.7856085453761
 It seems history is to blame216.32478516459074
  The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars2102.5695680451777
 Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs5695.38937339543
 A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son356547.10761974915
 Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger523.6720970239589
 Idle mockery168.82398997201176
 The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields22168.61615595391
  Hear, hear! Prolonged applause267.40861850351484
 _Zut! Nom de Dieu!_  —Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one26645.065105361533
 I don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either1904.0766299772465
 That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now343.06355134455475
  Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman1112.9195313495024
  —She’s making for Bullock harbour176.14965537783635
  The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain438.8681533282549
  —There’s five fathoms out there, he said914.8663247934414
 It’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one636.0972258292879
 It’s nine days today174.25574012016537
  The man that was drowned250.62539277696925
 A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite2880.5033017871615
 Here I am231.20324529067568
  They followed the winding path down to the creek730.4496677148386
 Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder1343.7112399574498
 A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water1679.7168710492665
  —Is the brother with you, Malachi?  —Down in Westmeath1040.3375797513809
 With the Bannons158.07981636984923
  —Still there? I got a card from Bannon300.9811042172438
 Says he found a sweet young thing down there257.94104621137103
 Photo girl he calls her204.866614923739
  —Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure852.5608104070385
  Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots374.05122792642004
 An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face784.5240801507435
  Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone13590.561883552518
  —Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock3673.3689468864945
 Chucked medicine and going in for the army370.8422345311583
  —Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said494.8175507621885
  —Going over next week to stew189.5999782967319
 You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?  —Yes1215.0355969297282
  —Spooning with him last night on the pier505.4645411683423
 The father is rotto with money203.54407978118974
  —Is she up the pole?  —Better ask Seymour that355.7497786996651
  —Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said255.25045362942865
  He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely:  —Redheaded women buck like goats2866.60785732952
  He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt394.51525545990813
  —My twelfth rib is gone, he cried545.5025365231915
 I’m the _Übermensch159.74487415338115
_ Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen334.7794856953874
  He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay3706.5552042541185
  —Are you going in here, Malachi?  —Yes1363.5086560380948
 Make room in the bed309.841175032318
  The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes5541.807940967427
 Haines sat down on a stone, smoking1391.2078516509948
  —Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked1778.1568487104435
  —Later on, Haines said506.25386263496944
 Not on my breakfast168.17475977245488
  Stephen turned away161.57271907811773
  —Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat57627.91198446752
  Stephen handed him the key449.8461919642582
 Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes201.9534543626244
  —And twopence, he said, for a pint6832.716751271465
 Throw it there182.08990545118402
  Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap314.4990690875487
 Dressing, undressing161.697286861065
 Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:  —He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord2639.2633531914335
 Thus spake Zarathustra162.84896555591584
  His plump body plunged160.43215454851355
  —We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish4032.4285538908753
  Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon832.08308479575
  —The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried1244.3904079282895
 Half twelve154.43692596079188
  —Good, Stephen said278.5984458039602
  He walked along the upwardcurving path169.0279970913662
      Turma circumdet110.58573012357814
      Iubilantium te virginum99.05302792448174
  The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly208.25273039322178
 I will not sleep here tonight220.02091797002717
 Home also I cannot go190.4513029289555
  A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea4139.489201532985
 Turning the curve he waved his hand201.76090201652616
 It called again162.03623271339433
 A sleek brown head, a seal’s, far out on the water, round3940.501107998617
  Usurper163.77729387478544
     [ 2 ]   —You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?  —Tarentum, sir1368.7085063166091
  —Very good104.59803220612062
 Well?  —There was a battle, sir1979.6125921017835
  —Very good104.59803220612062
 Where?  The boy’s blank face asked the blank window244.13864472657397
  Fabled by the daughters of memory432.1161304843815
 And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it1751.9202894110033
 A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings of excess763.4204249641299
 I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame1022.6961608194614
 What’s left us then?  —I forget the place, sir1658.8028315801096
 279 B164.56715343076627
 C22.206977252098767
  —Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book6767.852763048402
  —Yes, sir49.54011396252888
 And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done for2920.180230196568
_  That phrase the world had remembered193.73373687813978
 A dull ease of the mind192.76067232516033
 From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear322.147386806177
 Any general to any officers175.36406035877377
 They lend ear158.67304518712967
  —You, Armstrong, Stephen said662.3442292026335
 What was the end of Pyrrhus?  —End of Pyrrhus, sir?  —I know, sir203925.64744252258
 Ask me, sir, Comyn said2183.634196647573
  —Wait139.06507550823906
 You, Armstrong243.5215313235311
 Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?  A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel812.6769128464534
 He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly236.0656323324011
 Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips234.7712974517001
 A sweetened boy’s breath158.72750296705323
 Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy1526.4015360694484
 Vico Road, Dalkey187.10206197486357
  —Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier1147.4030327946612
  All laughed155.09150397452436
 Mirthless high malicious laughter171.58814114940736
 Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile263.46081248356256
 In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay4328.698948185295
  —Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book, what is a pier26046.423618027187
  —A pier, sir, Armstrong said1817.3912725271516
 A thing out in the water958.1953551038007
 A kind of a bridge1434.1586304240232
 Kingstown pier, sir335.770847477364
  Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning211.74381841025468
 Two in the back bench whispered664.9974171924363
 Yes33.412074807284164
 They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent246.45590037232336
 All98.80265906741536
 With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily484.9627785805695
 Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle338.6253175073194
  —Kingstown pier, Stephen said425.7053492003003
 Yes, a disappointed bridge172.51619090267891
  The words troubled their gaze161.78728568518383
  —How, sir? Comyn asked919.6858965576795
 A bridge is across a river192.72912099017515
  For Haines’s chapbook158.06364282262143
 No-one here to hear178.90859752671034
 Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind541.9330823109825
 What then? A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master’s praise2387.158063964495
 For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop381.2499681405202
  Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death293.7463851567083
 They are not to be thought away582.0604825391952
 Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted1476.7116064561887
 But can those have been possible seeing that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave, weaver of the wind1436.7629751348384
  —Tell us a story, sir455.72891336125076
  —O, do, sir451.7015495782005
 A ghoststory160.45069634593716
  —Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book1484.2081028313237
  —_Weep no more,_ Comyn said559.9790041482775
  —Go on then, Talbot250.54340077138593
  —And the story, sir?  —After, Stephen said5815.792757938157
 Go on, Talbot363.31194491006045
  A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel280.81074912335083
 He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:  _—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor35782.14587848805
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
_  It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible3722.305800906443
 Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night9120.31684253837
 By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy431.26430840581565
 Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds1002.8384660354407
 Thought is the thought of thought235.80282559771973
 Tranquil brightness168.73272870381456
 The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms28724.21873018307
 Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms362.67230445675636
  Talbot repeated:  _—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,  Through the dear might21812.71805679003
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
_  —Turn over, Stephen said quietly1353.4018370552653
 I don’t see anything204.74809660616683
  —What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward1002.1101553157496
  His hand turned the page over190.91020811264477
 He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered1287.9987523610012
 Of him that walked the waves333.91409595220136
 Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine1284.7534801264392
 It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute434.18960139281893
 To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s272.94291050556404
 A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church’s looms454.2329633032227

  —Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked251.09227884573835
  They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling196.70266102225804
 Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily:  —A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir7313.883624228903
  —O, ask me, sir252.02640667379623
  —A hard one, sir196.58300302753625
  —This is the riddle, Stephen said:       The cock crew,      The sky was blue:      The bells in heaven      Were striking eleven30366.958720653398
      ’Tis time for this poor soul      To go to heaven1244.75474757334
  What is that?  —What, sir?  —Again, sir8525.191457793457
 We didn’t hear164.70853730566827
  Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated217.82325152025274
 After a silence Cochrane said:  —What is it, sir? We give it up156824.49203222664
  Stephen, his throat itching, answered:  —The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush3347.5177019510816
  He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay1899.3671686066853
 Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues1204.6773287724377
  Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook386.50555459984776
 His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading466.56383155179964
 On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail’s bed1008.5666961890926
  He held out his copybook266.0081273145299
 The word _Sums_ was written on the headline312.30887875866506
 Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot2633.312980302918
 Cyril Sargent: his name and seal343.43189415639216
  —Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir68300.88571219373
  Stephen touched the edges of the book518.2676797136196
 Futility165.11363440604825
  —Do you understand how to do them now? he asked819.381833966687
  —Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered192.8733753462532
 Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir6057.206397036222
  —Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked730.011598388772
  —No, sir189.9834290822005
  Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail’s bed907.680445617848
 Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart4778.704972487744
 She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own208.72004565459088
 She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been454.28898339266897
 A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped44732.5267303798
  Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem451.8737529168549
 He proves by algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather169.05221840999727
 Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses197.2331183698545
 Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field646.2924914621884
  Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes3039.597961786278
 Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors438.87676450723205
 Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend64931.85240021175
  —Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?  —Yes, sir1499.5607992340554
  In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data165.55325030237887
 _Amor matris:_ subjective and objective genitive236.0070975529399
 With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands365.8086670900192
  Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness310.8186106196656
 My childhood bends beside me169.59235067135245
 Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly704.0749477020942
 Mine is far and his secret as our eyes246.10938208145268
 Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned6655.226520780749
  The sum was done181.80615903730268
  —It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up7363.063383551872
  —Yes, sir49.54011396252888
 Thanks, Sargent answered156.98205793389926
  He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench1102.8816549536946
  —You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form195559.6933391513
  —Yes, sir49.54011396252888
  In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield950.722028296909
  —Sargent!  —Run on, Stephen said398.8565056666915
 Mr Deasy is calling you171.04009271853064
  He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife1477.3567746256574
 They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet305.717000192097
 When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him1052.8586585897544
 He turned his angry white moustache163.59381320886428
  —What is it now? he cried continually without listening756.2290401999998
  —Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said5818.973558813517
  —Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here15610.155408424574
  And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly:  —What is the matter? What is it now?  Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head5582473.653198076
  Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs2063.120091305726
 As on the first day he bargained with me here919.9007698204206
 As it was in the beginning, is now8447.489082030368
 On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be574.398603327751
 And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end861.4447510386268
  A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor1584.0440326584958
 Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table720.925085752365
  —First, our little financial settlement, he said314.76259799410946
  He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong2818.0427932939156
 It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table8046.764237964603
  —Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away2854.543986607627
  And now his strongroom for the gold460.73426253245646
 Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James2283.4508604816174
 An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells183.93397924983924
  A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth2410.4415094399014
  —Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand9490.078919649286
 These are handy things to have190.40077568776235
 See62.48121371077237
 This is for sovereigns157.5883576200386
 This is for shillings159.2168278288293
 Sixpences, halfcrowns170.5497989781792
 See62.48121371077237
  He shot from it two crowns and two shillings307.72526333954653
  —Three twelve, he said248.8412864783152
 I think you’ll find that’s right191.60319971889473
  —Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers105054.50943708309
  —No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said656.3392999170579
 You have earned it158.7538091589666
  Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells1203.269720958652
 Symbols too of beauty and of power351.5475786648503
 A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery261.5254713162239
  —Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said3811.5573363506
 You’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it235.2957764734096
 You just buy one of these machines595.3369803750439
 You’ll find them very handy174.0568738040383
  Answer something159.87084654160307
  The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same1397.0018103131529
 Three times now168.7507109435952
 Three nooses round me here175.6847833891568
  —Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger3016.575695792108
 You don’t know yet what money is407.63610817574414
 Money is power164.06660006186465
 When you have lived as long as I have1108.150345981287
 I know, I know795.182527504562
 If youth but knew164.70660177597452
 But what does Shakespeare say? _Put but money in thy purse276.4999539561998
_  —Iago, Stephen murmured184.0837400849906
  He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare584.449764873075
  —He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said534.6270205459264
 He made money158.5721290914136
 A poet, yes, but an Englishman too1753.9226269351363
 Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s mouth?  The seas’ ruler63912.472417582525
 His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating5027.758394412651
  —That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets11974.472461816975
  —Ba! Mr Deasy cried215.55389445187595
 That’s not English148.84800747653853
 A French Celt said that182.92514519450287
  —I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast30979.87594455632
 _I paid my way169.66868337369698

 Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks’ board2119.0480996484443
 The lump I have is useless191.39374065724638
  —For the moment, no, Stephen answered8075.68303733016
  Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox360.7804317596983
  —I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously2945.424175160546
 But one day you must feel it212.92179412103334
 We are a generous people but we must also be just459.9746617316454
  —I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy5861.589440789459
  —You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said615.4461537268926
 I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time170.72442404668712
 I remember the famine in ’46180.86609045763538
 Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things4193.440493313112
  Glorious, pious and immortal memory190.34527289348983
 The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes278.5174083314891

 The black north and true blue bible195.6142836853262
 Croppies lie down173.73976629365717
  Stephen sketched a brief gesture181.07940365411076
 On the spindle side161.5728347951743
 But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union287.9578903645684
 We are all Irish, all kings’ sons281.6043715148316
  —Alas, Stephen said298.5198474332371
  —_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto2609.7245035742653
 He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so8426.755384019916

  —That reminds me, Mr Deasy said376.11244615902416
 You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends23835.481919908998
 I have a letter here for the press315.7632920003343
 Sit down a moment190.5085004266157
 I have just to copy the end243.80865542672407
  He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter5871.800580906767
  —Sit down161.0006035759617
 Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of common sense91455.81205283321
_ Just a moment275.6640786078194
  He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error13279.098049014958
  Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence204.6242099351864
 Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster’s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort’s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, 186642980.96733458788
 Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign250.02569054793366
 He saw their speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds275.4599926412803
  —Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys1195.117456160864

 Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts687.9703946939065
  —Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising2178.826420167007
  He came to the table, pinning together his sheets5470.77792992867
 Stephen stood up151.38416193813953
  —I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said428.1140495179187
 It’s about the foot and mouth disease334.7376644487266

  —Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said6964.477439372471
 England is in the hands of the jews3120.360133924817

  His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted567.1555385501426
  —A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?  —They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely468757.01018321613
 And you can see the darkness in their eyes386.4340593882842
 And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day1951.9260824562589

 Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures244.11698062089246
 Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain957.228923949964
 Vain patience to heap and hoard167.59088687692883
 A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on206.85824892607985
 Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh324.2274405489904
  —Who has not? Stephen said508.9935835387389
  —What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked2186.230986220837
  He came forward a pace and stood by the table1413.0414197070081
 His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly173.98935266516622
 Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me424.3818538093212
  —History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake42082.32113512906
  From the playfield the boys raised a shout369.7191688874543
 What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?  —The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said9808.911118699569
 All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God432.2147574737442
  Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:  —That is God11195.519287294612
  Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!  —What? Mr Deasy asked1390.2419995869582
  —A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders3968.4789859710518
 Looking up again he set them free213.48240049782711
  —I am happier than you are, he said1246.36661765014
 We have committed many errors and many sins189.34916339186697

  Stephen raised the sheets in his hand395.95700094359455
  —Well, sir, he began2152.386997549396
  —I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work17027.914999873978
 You were not born to be a teacher, I think1475.0828217317571
 Perhaps I am wrong225.52943930997128
  —A learner rather, Stephen said288.4912354456479
  And here what will you learn more?  Mr Deasy shook his head1532.138923979869
  —Who knows? he said414.8210104380805
 To learn one must be humble192.64859988718544
 But life is the great teacher309.08229288085244
  Stephen rustled the sheets again259.1361910716939
  —As regards these, he began331.40933073571523
  —Yes, Mr Deasy said326.86969076431586

 Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin585.7823110450931
  —Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket17638.302313468106
 Thank you87.27089161532128
  —Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk12163.886744677868
 I like to break a lance with you, old as I am1372.0118641776144
  —Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back7581.407453014024
  He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield78452.44785328099

  Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath334.3569513304254
  —I just wanted to say, he said1464.7583855300588
 Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews4422.190058461916
 Do you know that? No316.84906757752793
  —Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile8159.600835317496
  —Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly2470.6096256772853
  A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm309.5193944205912
 He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air1752.7252147038816
  —She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path2281.600471788394

 Looking for something lost in a past life430.26616862363403
 Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull1199.1143620748621
 The man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears178.22927650567877
 He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks366.8558631788856
 On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired218.19079920179553
 At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears237.53287234891528
 His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse202.98390335087757
 They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves907.1108833423071
  Cocklepickers163.77729387478544
 They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out4464.0082521085105
 The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning2396.5520096802716
 Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting from his jaws746.5976080961294
 His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop516.5552777755278
 The carcass lay on his path270.99215525167006
 He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell11819.576783057835

  —Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!  The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight15476.282541160224
 He slunk back in a curve437.5408754750602
 Doesn’t see me176.2284209994354
 Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it3172.9343399226154
 He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock766.0777152504853

 His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved213.66729495466544
 He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead106301.49346814882

 She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load181.69678348188506
 A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake427.16625456148887

 Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words2744.94535564649
  His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending421.42833826992995
 Why not endless till the farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds1345.4916839774023
 Me sits there with his augur’s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars1155.8794496832152
 I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back585.0193762493941
 Endless, would it be mine, form of my form? Who watches me here? Who ever anywhere will read these written words? Signs on a white field2416.7746560131645
 Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice207.19401136098296
 The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field2702.5613218137255

 Coloured on a flat: yes, that’s right862.1813690803672

 Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope272.7229388295951

 You find my words dark194.9702757388762
 Darkness is in our souls do you not think? Flutier544.6137141101414
 Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more2486.290986848743
  She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes381.71937958444573
 Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality852.0547236793333
 She, she, she448.5834023290282
 What she? The virgin at Hodges Figgis’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write8345.228050551164
 Keen glance you gave her211.59380608019057
 Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade232.13259340741703

 Touch, touch me236.92631237940213
  He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes11346.123132320996
 That is Kevin Egan’s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep275.4630609350236

 Welcome as the flowers in May213.04359077342144
 Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun209.63274637481507
 I am caught in this burning scene198.5095766232167
 Pan’s hour, the faunal noon289.5697651971018
 Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide280.9725024954576
 Pain is far176.3733614458825
       And no more turn aside and brood161.6622707495659
  His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck’s castoffs, _nebeneinander_619.0524630122609
 He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another’s foot had nested warm196.68902955591008
 The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove343.58517687803413

 Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks253.98894980966037
 In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels211.8198826226099
 And, spent, its speech ceases187.59244610739248
 It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling206.3276481771131

 Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh318.87492701727814
 Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit_888.1754022924389
 To no end gathered; vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon339.93019973488487

 He threw it208.27068237727485
 I remember133.84174587971827
 Did I not take it up?  His hand groped vainly in his pockets721.6085133474953
 No, I didn’t344.91221952806006

 For the rest let look who will220.10222520139607
  Behind153.42835129562317
 Perhaps there is someone176.07241687972106
  He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant222.19012449710388
 Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship7454.805972196488
     — II —   [ 4 ]  Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls987.1505341978299
 He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes462.6541100254997
 Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine322.210401794886
  Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray2497.1725528445136
 Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere2181.612690586155
 Made him feel a bit peckish227.3632309100028
  The coals were reddening160.22651867065278
  Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right1138.3265524037777
 She didn’t like her plate full219.77979543934416
 Right71.8813297140102
 He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire2049.588403392457
 It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out354.4046749771753
 Cup of tea soon277.4587848392064
 Good80.5876785951975
 Mouth dry156.83815600095866
 The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high1575.3975593688372
  —Mkgnao!  —O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire509476.0845884769
  The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing3995.5510260977408
 Just how she stalks over my writingtable185.09055619843835
 Prr108.82261696147798
 Scratch my head175.11028602778094
 Prr108.82261696147798
  Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form249.77329553772393
 Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes4798.587825689717
 He bent down to her, his hands on his knees9530.253586974994
  —Milk for the pussens, he said317.38890735858234
  —Mrkgnao! the cat cried287.0675265367076
  They call them stupid336.6772564984003
 They understand what we say better than we understand them247.39157560490833
 She understands all she wants to198.9079516040905
 Vindictive too173.2543006620492
 Cruel105.51961764735894
 Her nature161.4791485802795
 Curious mice never squeal157.48492837160947
 Seem to like it286.4564439957397
 Wonder what I look like to her248.04334525167317
 Height of a tower? No, she can jump me3262.944103798641
  —Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly10077.744410130308
 Afraid of the chookchooks413.1256380465342
 I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens233.87394023456426
  —Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly292.3921154760518
  She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth3879.7547800636585
 He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones414.339748209201
 Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor48557.364708788715
  —Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap977.6605623651006
  He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly294.14205013762097
 Wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after292.2963770855793
 Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips2059.5688653065636
 Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps1208.9388816325427
  He listened to her licking lap198.85630867114662
 No good eggs with this drouth196.07446018786868
 Want pure fresh water181.26989606145776
 Fried with butter, a shake of pepper334.78085565258544
 Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz’s242.42682672800484
 While the kettle is boiling244.5141244210445
 She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean202.6935990505218
 Why are their tongues so rough? To lap better, all porous holes288.02582942786074
 Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him368.30297841041084
 No30.4117530355444
  On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door2145.3700511534103
 She might like something tasty236.56032884601746
 Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning779.5855144594176
 Still perhaps: once in a way897.2480018926644
  He said softly in the bare hall:  —I’m going round the corner2613.8216234230476
 Be back in a minute547.0498222918563
  And when he had heard his voice say it he added:  —You don’t want anything for breakfast?  A sleepy soft grunt answered:  —Mn118176.04847168447
  No30.4117530355444
 She didn’t want anything177.2631761389844
 He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled1703.7070484114738
 Must get those settled really158.21568871116781
 Pity82.9885364610124
 All the way from Gibraltar251.7834971867224

 He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid1564.4249389587876
 Looked shut159.57442224564755
 All right till I come back anyhow230.60123009167677
  He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive378.61448358212954
 The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church454.15200153605923
 Be a warm day I fancy205.6726282157685
 Specially in these black clothes feel it more229.38780382184723

 But I couldn’t go in that light suit220.05963846875787

 Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun1409.42310410474

 He smiled, pleasing himself169.90457741918678
 What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland20821.90272821867
 He prolonged his pleased smile167.85370762645124

  He approached Larry O’Rourke’s157.0684499989541
 From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter211.25808606238965
 Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush244.66188057960815

 Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O’Rourke703.8620411953817
  Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway:  —Good day, Mr O’Rourke5028.224665425634
  —Good day to you281.58662461049875
  —Lovely weather, sir174.46455435066864

  Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar5662.279399487533

 Fifteen multiplied by167.9211138958181
 The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade902.1198818403903
 The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood355.6830639274915

 Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands3728.7160598783757
 The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack476.00722486063427
  The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace1834.9634754143085
  —Now, my miss, he said726.4820489293685
  She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out270.5664465332436
  —Thank you, my miss570.8196495711705

 Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth1623.3181269795916
 No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters234.13639711062723

 It bore the oldest, the first race627.6686885100582
 A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck484.26377615667207
 The oldest people166.7133030306037
 Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere2861.517179745522

 Now it could bear no more282.1462328657806
  Desolation163.77729387478544
  Grey horror seared his flesh170.19605260498685
 Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward2531.7177183252425

 Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind5709.463253607781
  Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor505.2173763239365

 Mrs Marion Bloom142.46448979077647
 Mrs Marion63.86725159555496
  —Poldy!  Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head1678.740646692611
  —Who are the letters for?  He looked at them2261.4794166657557

  —A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you43328.35930917908
 And a letter for you278.17805165481644
  He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees568.9222065227906
  —Do you want the blind up?  Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow3910.592696234392
  —That do? he asked, turning3144.0691818506807
  She was reading the card, propped on her elbow426.70710617610956
  —She got the things, she said264.64177748273545
  He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh576.0296150831523
  —Hurry up with that tea, she said688.4678394022988
 I’m parched154.39699533388975
  —The kettle is boiling, he said364.3787767539486
  But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed4710.415583213798
  As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:  —Poldy!  —What?  —Scald the teapot30267.78926081713
  On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout484.33628350569205
 He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in1405.9353263886803
 Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt2304.390121388099
 While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him376.12448539343166

 Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s seaside girls281.668155022148
  The tea was drawn180.98839337159944
 Silly Milly’s birthday gift157.59004993409147
 Only five she was then203.10518389603968
 No, wait: four179.7460883552591
 I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke338.74862730977367
 Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her258.9774531165271
 He smiled, pouring177.41661150322074
       O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling641.1206919115249
      You are my lookingglass from night to morning254.16297163577445
      I’d rather have you without a farthing      Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden275.29576568526437
  Poor old professor Goodwin171.60959879073988
 Dreadful old case159.43242171960833
 Still he was a courteous old chap1038.6198362032387
 Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform1145.3247529850437
 And the little mirror in his silk hat611.3841667432499
 The night Milly brought it into the parlour629.235967750274
 O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! All we laughed552.7507226550371
 Sex breaking out even then187.8115589126583
 Pert little piece she was202.5865825526171
  He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray787.2687244996235
 Its hump bumped as he took it up840.066024376998
 Yes33.412074807284164
 He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle402.1830595109669
  Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead8684.824354187711
  —What a time you were! she said263.8011210736193
  She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow453.86985012297174
 He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder357.4585955384115
 The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured2546.9001367359347
  A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow685.187047429833
 In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread596.1748891438917
  —Who was the letter from? he asked656.2912346435191
  Bold hand150.94136644108536
 Marion105.11172575087537
  —O, Boylan, she said258.9745757514987
 He’s bringing the programme174.9188095006313
  —What are you singing?  —_Là ci darem_ with J621.3075947741395
 C22.206977252098767
 Doyle, she said, and _Love’s Old Sweet Song_18055.670306821925
  Her full lips, drinking, smiled323.76781587527313
 Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day193.44237112970663
 Like foul flowerwater158.29827773188617
  —Would you like the window open a little?  She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:  —What time is the funeral?  —Eleven, I think, he answered1529019.4116724555
 I didn’t see the paper264.5236832795107
  Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed2417.36131100778
 No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole297.89572518170223
  —No: that book210.02328539341408
  Other stocking151.32260205475782
 Her petticoat161.62216069654139
  —It must have fell down, she said719.2791714756873
  He felt here and there378.04068104388534
 _Voglio e non vorrei_153.51783507658013
 Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_532.7769926049116
 Not in the bed423.4400324660319
 Must have slid down164.4489533176794
 He stooped and lifted the valance180.89434444328572
 The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot663.3083528518738
  —Show here, she said202.96824746993255
 I put a mark in it228.75178720379802
 There’s a word I wanted to ask you1066.5339819085518
  She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word20062.546841936983
  —Met him what? he asked539.9951793103555
  —Here, she said180.29468312998492
 What does that mean?  He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail481.6571291400813
  —Metempsychosis?  —Yes365.6580192155475
 Who’s he when he’s at home?  —Metempsychosis, he said, frowning4765.993588682956
 It’s Greek: from the Greek592.549028426818
 That means the transmigration of souls186.54329047128954
  —O, rocks! she said249.23216005451798
 Tell us in plain words187.87392367796025
  He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes217.70227558942256
 The same young eyes239.70270778136864
 The first night after the charades395.2760600946369

  —Did you finish it? he asked564.8526152839773
  —Yes, she said339.36672258509566
 There’s nothing smutty in it174.13109294801038
 Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?  —Never read it10971.442008323043
 Do you want another?  —Yes590.9178078744316
 Get another of Paul de Kock’s263.2159499278674

  —Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before39847.67490560637
 They call it reincarnation339.4645265975982
 That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet1861.1414147987603
 Some say they remember their past lives196.5996954166775
  The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea191.58175184450315
 Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis670.4711725715931

 An example?  The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed489.4691214969005

 Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then864.5653761275007
 They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance1370.1470918980747
 What they called nymphs, for example354.6299032276587
  Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar224.27361709316057
 She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils229.9495859964667
  —There’s a smell of burn, she said484.41937379862225
 Did you leave anything on the fire?  —The kidney! he cried suddenly4081.8640768841124
  He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs4884.422347010775
 Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan3628.166191663197
 By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back405.45175380747725
 Only a little burnt171.70277555101356
 He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it1215.4512210225173
  Cup of tea now276.32022196872396
 He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf1025.46430847256
 Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat673.6400617916498
 Done to a turn344.51099917798143
 A mouthful of tea168.49346682411925
 Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth41826.581576095436
 What was that about some young student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth22679.5972905373

 Her first birthday away from home186.98570111576305
 Separation165.56637469817665
 Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street2137.2857098539894
 Jolly old woman180.44035623676672
 Lot of babies she must have helped into the world645.7390189819477
 She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn’t live370.36072515042713
 Well, God is good, sir225.79683968062747
 She knew at once171.22204500083842

  The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door2045.410638083254

  He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels321.7286510004674
 He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers525.7181298989063

  In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_505.6860236676068
 He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it7441.9446360341635
 The cat went up in soft bounds196.2907599880506
 Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed1804.4755153498934
  Listening, he heard her voice:  —Come, come, pussy7131.953421263101
 Come50.05291484081755
  He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden1488.1571080758358

 He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel365.0336418726352

 While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair6571.820459317558
 Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha1472.8210444729818

 Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed329.8774666904995
 A batch knelt at the altarrails263.80471200926803
 The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands4272.146727656835
 He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth9299.07908701699
 Her hat and head sank254.93194069701687

  He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places1742.5404741116224
 He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper909.0714963091443

 They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs9546.65158575508

  The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly389.8039474957915
 Wine103.78305238140578
 Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness’s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley’s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane’s ginger ale (aromatic)663.9430026063332

 Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench3433.405873215019
 The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin147086.04979625408

  —Good, Mr Bloom said256.46129617742855
  He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand13159.926960538127
  At his armpit Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said:  —Hello, Bloom4334.623109920067

  —I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said6375.53034043521
  Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly371.48283930236977
  —What’s that? his sharp voice said322.03399730539275
  —I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered2427.677754582873
 I was going to throw it away that moment2094.2877732677157
  Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom’s arms691.5803910231422
  —I’ll risk it, he said295.7223996430224

  He sped off towards Conway’s corner177.50420949979988

  He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved3791.23342611
 He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower12212.716599279876
     [ 6 ]   Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself3254.820257650971
 Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care633.752567735388
  —Come on, Simon168.38110365391617
  —After you, Mr Bloom said407.9254005023701

  Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place243.93217959027302
 He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight982.6002909073053

 Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses’ hoofs479.78484282994464
 A jolt153.42391798351298
 Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying222.76616365036207
 Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind175.71177121592027
 The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar335.90272998407534

  —That’s a fine old custom, he said319.4160506387878

  All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers215.69490653615506
 Respect166.14681137988097
 Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat1252.7837646075984
  —There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said2418.778974099761
  —Who is that?  —Your son and heir1534.4411321955379
  —Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across5118.86982592282
  The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels9001.82976158101
 Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:  —Was that Mulligan cad with him? His _fidus Achates_!  —No, Mr Bloom said10591.986792409667

 There’s the sun again coming out211.52747645209223
  Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky542.9346174090773
  —It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said317.7826271324194
  —We’re off again181.37672087813326
  The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently258.14053550251634
 Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard327.30997694491424
  —Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said497.6934206209718

 _His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience45060.57836098034

 He’s dead nuts on that236.0972191413645

       It is now a month since dear Henry fled      To his home up above in the sky      While his family weeps and mourns his loss      Hoping some day to meet him on high1247.2818620617404
  I tore up the envelope? Yes301.4227347162739
 Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket3457.662657586881

  A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom’s window244.0709811746518
 Couldn’t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?  Antient concert rooms6296.204991307834

  They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen’s theatre: in silence4991.673591623835

 Who was he?  —How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute284336.95589933725
  —He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said411.0174950551036
 Yes, he does267.50104918018667
 How do you do?  —Who? Mr Dedalus asked1770.0312725435392
  —Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said645.6212650789236
 There he is airing his quiff234.52968338865483
  Mr Dedalus bent across to salute259.839113717113
 From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed12052.336315103748
  Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand5670.792084077437
 The nails, yes183.67003541629464
 Is there anything more in him that they she sees? Fascination388.4538804485871
 Worst man in Dublin273.31191720801456
 That keeps him alive168.5808976447454

 But a type like that176.3927313464964
 My nails162.24295932347945
 I am just looking at them: well pared555.3075807217696
 Body getting a bit softy316.1546591959159
 I would notice that: from remembering212.89144966972924
 What causes that? I suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off990.3677631644574
 But the shape is there254.90205811294675
 The shape is there still271.64509413550377

 Shift stuck between the cheeks behind199.26585630310487
  He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces614.8248828291257
  Mr Power asked:  —How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?  —O, very well, Mr Bloom said151253.46992299054
 I hear great accounts of it178.3953181112531
 It’s a good idea, you see324.46506296439463
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
  —Are you going yourself?  —Well no, Mr Bloom said2181.6618709032737
 In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business22806.383045140563
 You see the idea is to tour the chief towns615.2212907879385
 What you lose on one you can make up on the other3621.205594267226
  —Quite so, Martin Cunningham said239.887311595067
 Mary Anderson is up there now199.3664722364775
  Have you good artists?  —Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said691.4975121195488

  —And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling2285.5120208082017
 Last but not least239.02315954389152
  Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them668.3252994023596

 The carriage wheeling by Farrell’s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees165.7693697266674

 A throstle153.84442584719795
 There is a word throstle that expresses that343.6164065945062
  His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face185.32648048856313
 Greyish over the ears265.9652585701752
 _Madame_: smiling258.2304410877196
 I smiled back159.62070806705145
 A smile goes a long way411.9224391067309
 Only politeness perhaps156.62362896336452
 Nice fellow159.85082137307802
 Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife637.9399931007398
 Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal30015.113031890436
 You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick233.6181894185166
 Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak1413.4896991088526
 What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury’s472.9479166192252
 Or the Moira, was it?  They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator’s form2344.5159382767106
  Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power176.629853751078
  —Of the tribe of Reuben, he said983.219730256895
  A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine5789.0699575462295
  Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:  —The devil break the hasp of your back!  Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray’s statue36281.45136674872
  —We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly2424.7780572772226
  His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes195.38323746514632
 He caressed his beard, adding:  —Well, nearly all of us6505.22449663091
  Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces453.49403860234133
  —That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son454.92934767441915
  —About the boatman? Mr Power asked277.98361190967387
  —Yes64.35005941618248
 Isn’t it awfully good?  —What is that? Mr Dedalus asked24200.37415960399
 I didn’t hear it176.53219430875302
  —There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were both35191092.33363927
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
  —What? Mr Dedalus asked258.2251371239255
 That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?  —Yes, Mr Bloom said6199.605271749568
 They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown9969.61977576967
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
  —Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried518.517825036779
 I wish to Christ he did!  Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils1103.0623110744164
  —No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself4598.126530449815
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
  Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:  —Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey29553.618107258128
  —For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright522.3568171138779
 Is he dead?  —Dead! Martin Cunningham cried800.632450984412
 Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive134401.34718888937
 Half the town was there195.33936464308042
  —Yes, Mr Bloom said85.04413539111384
 But the funny part is167.01662459851082

5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
  A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand223.94125454570278
  —O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed7863.293748177621
 Like a hero167.02624282732776
 A silver florin167.61901548691623
  —Isn’t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly6028.75481112479
  —One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily5428.128279364125
  Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage447.8636978495158
  —Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!  —We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said6637.510404426191
  Mr Dedalus sighed150.69046928118019
  —Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh10371.45833210462
 Many a good one he told himself684.9434281295645
  —The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers5023.739942623717
 Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this173201.361537654
 He’s gone from us168.72159325006817
 He went very suddenly159.43604863243323
  —Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said235.47378801134536

  He tapped his chest sadly187.98596381916082

 A lot of money he spent colouring it561.6611595795109
  Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension375.64796131160017
  —He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said3191.135154158155
  —The best death, Mr Bloom said301.91787775469373
  Their wide open eyes looked at him286.13486244423865
  —No suffering, he said249.11256068259215
 A moment and all is over329.808630331886

  —But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life108731.7957533479
  Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back1137.1649905295194
  —The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added2130.5130890916043
  —Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively7349.139473241681
 We must take a charitable view of it221.82187601742712

  —What’s wrong now?  A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups984.357285610686

  —And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road23817.183307192852

 Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel1177.2235046936435
 The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks556.7745628566886
 Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it3824.548736208159
 He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously1679.0756851048106
  A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door1041.752497808442
 The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s belly9472.376785450042
 Who’ll read the book? I, said the rook629.2014944178421

  The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s bucket and shook it over the coffin144911.632726797
 Then he walked to the other end and shook it again1132.1243192268312

 Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket417.94852821481743
 He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left680.4457475411942

  —He’s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O’65291.58887078375

 How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!  —Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said2949.0269266495525

  Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk1541.8700088910798
 Mr Power took his arm194.42677301021757
  —She’s better where she is, he said kindly6489.358943416391
  —I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp9718.50704727537

  —Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely436.26402496088605
  Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head1170.0242705323985

  —The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don’t you think? Mr Kernan said with reproof3879.6537301835656

  Mr Kernan added:  —The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say14744.173391056327
  Mr Bloom gave prudent assent173.73890241619074
 The language of course was another thing522.9197252105831

  —As it should be, Mr Kernan said1456.2339119211085
  —What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said452.5092873575581
  Mr Kernan assured him157.31698434278678
  —Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked1689.4238296315336
 I know his face110.48905022013821
  Ned Lambert glanced back173.6959250473671
  —Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano93268.6463130094
 She’s his wife168.03848262682925
  —O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said4883.6676366852125
 I haven’t seen her for some time403.4781608555838
 She was a finelooking woman310.5319378096271
 I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown3112.0360526928703
 And a good armful she was200.65717476817406
  He looked behind through the others190.6050979738389
  —What is he? he asked1992.355277803718
 What does he do? Wasn’t he in the stationery line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls5518.400323493789
  Ned Lambert smiled163.33120231115814
  —Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely’s114276.2642279402
 A traveller for blottingpaper166.27612327727294
  —In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for? She had plenty of game in her then42284.228127258386
  —Has still, Ned Lambert said351.79788601597966
 He does some canvassing for ads253.55307938843515
  John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead310.1557488230598
  The barrow turned into a side lane210.90157816091764
 A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage994.107598510047
 The gravediggers touched their caps168.0637978048498
  —John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased1771.238928961108
 He never forgets a friend180.67507353926766
  Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence237.2527092060556
 Mr Dedalus said:  —I am come to pay you another visit25598.82654656794
  —My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice360.2667593947953
 I don’t want your custom at all188.57096964205806
  Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back5719.073956522038
  —Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?  —I did not, Martin Cunningham said130237.92002306653
 The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles555.4832586695502
  —They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs134618.42416384778
 They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried1156.4242411445261
 After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough566.857724946511
 One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy679.2443874970128
 The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up783.2912786754109
  The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed1239.255481756528
 He resumed:  —And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he107248.32883593212
  Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked2005.0927662963684
  —I know, Hynes said303.1813193413352
 I know that130.53217142237244
  —To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said290.00138735394376
 It’s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else180.21150562546882
  Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk168.0202558693648
 All want to be on good terms with him1312.852909977368

  —How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked394.2668305194058
  —Two, Corny Kelleher said163.28291501498902
 Half ten and eleven179.99896238633966
  The caretaker put the papers in his pocket410.3393416757609
 The barrow had ceased to trundle244.12164547636573
 The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves2776.8354878627483

 A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life635.1296431563655
 Yes, he could534.789018937045
 Still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave1577.078449030342

 Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it2052.8658987348535
       O, poor Robinson Crusoe!      How could you possibly do so?  Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box3329.5271123962916
 When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood2492.795817974689

  The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles1312.044469263477

 The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space2424.780564382002

  The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin660.1250134281443
 Mr Bloom turned away his face197.6258873777545
 And if he was alive all the time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course2067101.232668161
 Of course he is dead708.5914955870833

 Begin to be forgotten245.38409372937355
 Out of sight, out of mind929.7876716174968
  The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat980.376438414888
 Had enough of it262.3598898660363
 The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show649.1509958329715
 Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves8151.066112087807
 Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields402.8183978012653
 Ah, the names331.07064741396766
 But he knows them all253.14728570911385
 No: coming to me183.1493159093542
  —I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath1505.6981082246125
 What is your christian name? I’m not sure393.6555447032925
  —L, Mr Bloom said264.9734231057167
 Leopold152.07890796771662
 And you might put down M’Coy’s name too337.47865895238226
 He asked me to200.62872732535388
  —Charley, Hynes said writing569.7528693866361
 I know77.80995836676394
 He was on the _Freeman_ once4333.07278103392
  So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne824.0355804035045
 Good idea a postmortem for doctors159.18630001491888
 Find out what they imagine they know376.3885208322583
 He died of a Tuesday258.7798649737998
 Got the run167.2279288148384
 Charley, you’re my darling189.3313098790076
 O well, does no harm192.63344890096437
 I saw to that, M’Coy420.43995117304235
 Thanks, old chap: much obliged288.88499752758855
 Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing192.65612374819406

  He looked around153.67907798483256
  —Macintosh161.3551978654616
 Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said3043.2784121939285
 Where is he now?  —M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling2082.0310078067937
 I don’t know who he is538.2309144180299
 Is that his name?  He moved away, looking about him926.3253068053966
  —No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping1139.2862549993295
 I say, Hynes!  Didn’t hear491.38423817608066
 What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign855.2131585829868
 Well of all the775.8052917937073
 Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell231.3990597681512
 Become invisible168.90896771168843
 Good Lord, what became of him?  A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade1116.5428272257
  —O, excuse me!  He stepped aside nimbly833.642265682746
  Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole4590.569541914249
 It rose159.08529382703983
 Nearly over156.58578430059006
 A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades3521.2148552638673
 All uncovered again for a few instants810.6072977076778
 The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump566.6215100378503
 The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow412.8161821509216
 Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean452.0719546289302
 One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass257.37063948692304
 One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing291.18082839696757
 Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband199.5822549441522
 His navelcord154.47815885584637
 The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand716.5559159059526
 Thanks in silence165.44680554598818
 Sorry, sir: trouble184.07902361801706

 I know that130.53217142237244
 For yourselves just159.35270972180288
  The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb542.4841125247395
  —Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said952.4452899170719
 We have time155.34534367043395
  —Let us, Mr Power said262.3972584707541
  They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts656.1563403635806
 With awe Mr Power’s blank voice spoke:  —Some say he is not in that grave at all1722.6383355688915
 That the coffin was filled with stones207.59287608576727
 That one day he will come again323.11213573721955
  Hynes shook his head189.96177446259256
  —Parnell will never come again, he said416.70210121596995
 He’s there, all that was mortal of him659.3031438197307
 Peace to his ashes177.06763791250816
  Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland’s hearts and hands474.16328420283475
 More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living372.1475652821506

  A STREET CORTÈGE   Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots6207.443215550871

 O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands224.79114317152283
  —What’s that? Myles Crawford said with a start3201.202107389378
 Where are the other two gone?  —Who? the professor said, turning25545.357249107747
 Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall219.9404858420322
 Came over last night182.3585045135671
  —Come on then, Myles Crawford said431.8656845743492
 Where’s my hat?  He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket948.3387401173
 They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer2961.090724893444
  —He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice2131.3968455949407
  —Seems to be, J564.9804151533382

 O’Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems8946.227836802405
 Who has the most matches?  THE CALUMET OF PEACE   He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself718.8003510541257
 Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn396.9176663692241

 O’Molloy opened his case again and offered it220.50386870828012
  —_Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself883.7726919309432
  The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow3723.6716379860754
 He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:       ’Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,      ’Twas empire charmed thy heart1987.2826947964472
  The professor grinned, locking his long lips219.7572969328009
  —Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said742.9676488183143
  He took a cigarette from the open case474.0937538079992
 Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said:  —Silence for my brandnew riddle!  —_Imperium romanum_, J11788.707425139886

 O’Molloy said gently149.2149288972773
 It sounds nobler than British or Brixton179.75916679194367
 The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire211.00312742673555
  Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling228.5905807006514

 The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession2164.3413767721863

  —Help! he sighed198.8029157038493

  Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues367.4543023069579
  The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across Stephen’s and Mr O’Madden Burke’s loose ties1655.7229716836018

 Wait a moment103.86440965293562
 Let me say one thing180.98224451381648
 The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society1221.2406280795337
 Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue3846.742412178751
  He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:  —You know Gerald Fitzgibbon4513.457070485703

  —He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s frock27217.05164103945
 Well?  —It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement375451.76968989306
 It was then a new movement323.55630219937433
 We were weak, therefore worthless173.4243851666636
  He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus8883.68593752429
  IMPROMPTU   In ferial tone he addressed J198.8896563878854

 O’Molloy:  —Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed2675.4032081314926
 That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall21877.233338189566
 His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it225.66951752596475
 He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man1527.2503893458993

 His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair379.5182527966975
 Still seeking, he said:  —When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply23847.584588002206
 Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these3083.3898204426173
  He raised his head firmly178.23887810936475
 His eyes bethought themselves once more173.1769835508904
 Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet920.7046130029314
  He began:  _—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend29219.47245636044
 It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses396336.986063828

 I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me346.6690357141808
_  FROM THE FATHERS   It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted5899.38156562215
 Ah, curse you! That’s saint Augustine213.20348456530377
  _—Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people6991.041616422531
 You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe2048.992643236294

_  A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech191.96280422345413
 He lifted his voice above it boldly:  _—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day33489160.169531427
 He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw172870.93192306612

 They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits3458210.8424475593

 Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!  —The play begins1014.648057900584
 A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice6961.912382041176
 He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name:       Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit,  bidding him list18560.092252805185
 To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever708672.6248091687
  Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son’s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet’s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?  —But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently99155223964.82608

  —A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine2849.7344551443025
 What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?  —Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world2583.1798059376533
 What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit nomen!_), Socratididion’s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know20737.592793933527

  —He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory25189.69877375337

 Blushing, his mask said:  —Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating8568.0271437964
  He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:  —Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?  Alarmed face asks me3519256.25167709
 Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?  —Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering205769.2582788657

  —As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image50226.52050199593
 And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth454402.9586689372

 Why does he send to one who is a _buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written _Romeo and Juliet_150905.1679931582

  —It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion3084562.5330827893
 Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife41245.854790861784
 But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow639.6014712784438

 All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan’s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killed her first70255028.2759258

  Woa!  —Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type6004.3410419076445
  —He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer949692.3818141104
 Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?  —It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely82162.21630038563

  —Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions121945.17260550472
 He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it1720.2647482145294

_   He turned a happy patch’s smirk to Stephen, saying:  —The disguise, I fear, is thin24338.213866259473
  He read, _marcato:_  —Characters:       TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)      CRAB (a bushranger)      MEDICAL DICK )          and      ) (two birds with one stone)      MEDICAL DAVY )      MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)      FRESH NELLY          and      ROSALIE (the coalquay whore)18928.617875976885
  He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:  —O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!  —The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them10059224251.067545

 J14.055315956249904
 Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown8975.970868642633
  Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square179.4750837857357
 He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days759575.8523833633

  —Very well, indeed, father555.5242884144292
 And you, father?  Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed607.0547986450155
 He would go to Buxton probably for the waters344.8627476838221
 And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that6859.069119855589
 And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London229.33352831370726

 Yes, he would certainly call874.7227295608884
  —Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy263.37680741061143
  Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun25008.131117634828
 And smiled yet again, in going341.568653697373
 He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste521.6651118953173
  Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice1233.2261264095084
  —Pilate! Wy don’t you old back that owlin mob?  A zealous man, however312.8111067702874

 And really did great good in his way322.72134222135406

 That letter to father provincial266.1209184925246
  Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square1225.0499645191142

 Gallaher156.2857900245429
 And the other little man? His name was Brunny Lynam1310.832768325424
  Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street16722.726297659912
  —But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said678.8216413778437
  The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:  —O, sir3117.524299305148
  —Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said8004.5679925529475
  Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox3074.905854671805
 Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east397.6276890125046
  Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court45150.42613942377
  Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?  Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed2552.963874398039
 And Father Conmee smiled and saluted590.8079399453089
 How did she do?  A fine carriage she had264.0394689899242
 Like Mary, queen of Scots, something520.0105480540944

  A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street205.2210519414743
 All raised untidy caps151.6678132176702
 Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly407.4965163369352
 Christian brother boys180.2138489855895

 For aged and virtuous females165.9002954999953
 Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament1417.3535759003923
 Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered232.36253029357806
  Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman495.6713657334474
 And now it was an office or something548.0960865164676
  Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop15515.334932809841
 Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter831.4970037125302
 He passed Grogan’s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York360.5652925825611
 In America those things were continually happening185.989633313919
 Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared1340.4752488437407
 Still, an act of perfect contrition342.67318574518424
  Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged764.5861593978813
 They saluted him and were saluted199.5734084493872
  Father Conmee passed H156.36567483469736

 O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay592.619300913611
 A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable2278.9503641388064
 In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes1337.5792104432574
  Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him9206.069069541001
 It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people48672.43833374274
  On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S340.1254484280512
 J14.055315956249904
 of saint Francis Xavier’s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram1287.1870775123184

 C22.206977252098767
 of saint Agatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge307.82070701036974
  At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island842.2142662388205
  Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse29931.205006390526
 Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket553.6968003118743
 The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap3219.2102275717166
 Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum160.17867054985325
  It was a peaceful day283.1199946120328
 The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down475.11856356629033
 A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses4446.341416543225
 She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly1114.0989979547044
  Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car211.27112780244812
 He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat24088.457554482422
  Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head3843.438381006197
  At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight128593.85912501629
 The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her369.9774420562682
 She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been absolved, _pray for me1123154543.0836651
_ But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures823.7194359444941
  From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee294.16165456207983

 and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night140837.43805685634
 That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea756.9452656909112
 Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D1906.882147544161
V108.7839396229068
) been brought168.99051602484693
 But they were God’s souls, created by God425.45485026966236
 It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say3234.9366585508847
  At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn733.634010215112
  The Malahide road was quiet164.8507013662784
 It pleased Father Conmee, road and name414.35714965625334
 The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide182.65985077089977
 Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining533.0053576595132
 Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day1811.9330481112613
 Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony608.2671512807361
  Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere440884.6851225523
  A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged4932.207601273714
 Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with her husband’s brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did12065.517161055523
 Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother1085.036395063002
  Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways26324.823245587286
  Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore723.6123754737284
 He was humane and honoured there166.01655949716022
 He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters416.2950252689943
 And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee2711.7026992797773
  It was a charming day291.7075819313031
  The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves544.8694105284478
 The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind538.5843867766979
 _Moutonner,_ the French said449.5111483595201
 A just and homely word173.07947828862652
  Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey640.8752837642834
 His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field287.12007145380215
 He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening10707.834865968523
 He was their rector: his reign was mild199.7853142713382
  Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out583.9305938443874
 An ivory bookmark told him the page212.8535308997288
  Nones165.11363440604825
 He should have read that before lunch326.0331061140638
 But lady Maxwell had come184.22354479664372
  Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast1295.3866435339353
 _Deus in adiutorium175.81534961994424
_  He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ1877.1749555238928
_  A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand2826.8676178736187
 The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig970.4253310023023
  Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary251.35592436859406
 _Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum204.40296976239404
 He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings2131.2969634993856
 Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway2658.6348249256457
 There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out945.232998189167
  Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge450.55357301798205
  Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay846.0318121175316
  Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day4493.998255356252
  —That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher514.3649644871546
  —Ay, Corny Kelleher said165.4902171174664
  —It’s very close, the constable said346.41818980839236
  Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin3059.7711659963525
  —What’s the best news? he asked246.16325639237886
  —I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath811.6861854765058
  *    *    *   A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirting Rabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street683.6154128708351
 Towards Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:  —_For England_4253.375245031295

 O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor2246.4109776812033
  A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her2683.0280654857465
 The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides1363.0032101280215
  He halted and growled angrily:  —_For England_1258.0293234668165
5.2325521685823055
  Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths544.5896286221961
  He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply:  —_home and beauty2129.4133939655644
_  The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased316.8255237316498
 The blind of the window was drawn aside369.73584596956954
 A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell198.76310834752354
 A woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings736.9650238923933
 It fell on the path310.3232905715176
  One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel’s cap, saying:  —There, sir90207.63412454168

  —Did you put in the books? Boody asked405.42508525340634
  Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow475.7161471146006
  —They wouldn’t give anything on them, she said424.8826632606494
  Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble313.8294716809648
  —Where did you try? Boody asked316.15829564705075
  —M’Guinness’s159.3233427735895
  Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table416.8585977877119
  —Bad cess to her big face! she cried267.80002762355997
  Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes934.6256212315166
  —What’s in the pot? she asked329.33055099692064
  —Shirts, Maggy said165.4589975787353
  Boody cried angrily:  —Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?  Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:  —And what’s in this?  A heavy fume gushed in answer115907.91741397201
  —Peasoup, Maggy said163.21200364601742
  —Where did you get it? Katey asked472.33384577059246
  —Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said182.76459391378316
  The lacquey rang his bell145.4861338086963
  —Barang!  Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:  —Give us it here9581.499920574588
  Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl257.0855004890474
 Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs:  —A good job we have that much11018.990716944463
 Where’s Dilly?  —Gone to meet father, Maggy said256.9064630793422
  Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:  —Our father who art not in heaven2804.2995804106017
  Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey’s bowl, exclaimed:  —Boody! For shame!  A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George’s quay13594.865061321198

 Good afternoon, Mr Lambert239.56111536139272
 Very pleased to have met you224.40816767443278

 O’Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary’s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O’Connor, Wexford439.8986724461287
  He stood to read the card in his hand372.14628396491383

  Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air467.3593469078595
  —God! he cried281.0710801505715
 I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral4049.7963233470487
_ He mightn’t like it, though321.5844994950981
 What? God, I’ll tell him anyhow414.98822449965576
 That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor348.88316345860505
 Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines9479.234878195297
  The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness228.53597261645598
 He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:  —Woa, sonny!  He turned to J3375.1945479249875
 J14.055315956249904
 O’Molloy and asked:  —Well, Jack3116.7061122043674
 What is it? What’s the trouble? Wait awhile916.6903931361761
 Hold hard101.07435980917306
  With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly1504.0054227035173

 In here, see258.9719389762408
 Turn Now On104.81648762159537
  He slid it into the left slot for them1160.0238734085424
 It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six335.9171946110985
  Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude193137.88908055297
  —See? he said171.88491726630878
 See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over387.8949931005403
 The impact163.8085958093295
 Leverage, see?  He showed them the rising column of disks on the right3331.052587269463
  —Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling580.0930403913243
 So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over395.0318644186942
  —See? Tom Rochford said176.6306294054503
  He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four350.8950110669747
 Turn Now On104.81648762159537
  —I’ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him20449.715572440382
 One good turn deserves another172.89157243164814
  —Do, Tom Rochford said195.75689635935547
 Tell him I’m Boylan with impatience200.0677349068322
  —Goodnight, M’Coy said abruptly611.8738214728148

5.2325521685823055

  —But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked434.6206832338258
  —Tooraloo, Lenehan said225.77550896716383
 See you later172.6869814407486
  —He’s a hero, he said simply2830.387097205867
  —I know, M’Coy said150.69234405183678
 The drain, you mean373.8216703213175
  —Drain? Lenehan said205.4550438579801
 It was down a manhole256.18368718781977
  They passed Dan Lowry’s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile1177.5630847094926
  Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M’Coy how the whole thing was1548.4899676200694
 One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas28756.684571938444
 Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky’s vest and all, with the rope round him4504.690563508015
 And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up16590.66652476505
  —The act of a hero, he said1161.4585920916643
  At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street280.9171183661246
  —This way, he said, walking to the right4546.470034268915
 I want to pop into Lynam’s to see Sceptre’s starting price326.456559922732
 What’s the time by your gold watch and chain?  M’Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses’ sombre office, then at O’Neill’s clock1253.3204322241493
  —After three, he said267.376845875627
 Who’s riding her?  —O725.6831161236845
 Madden, Lenehan said220.20954391183096
 And a game filly she is184.2120324070855
  While he waited in Temple bar M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter397.20670255547344
 Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark572.3884785734161
  The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade579.2349838763263
  —Even money, Lenehan said returning845.6455434740125
 I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an earthly1729.0256573848505
 Through here157.11147046066216
  —There he is, Lenehan said487.1282301906646
  —Wonder what he’s buying, M’Coy said, glancing behind1767.7654885111306
  —_Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye,_ Lenehan said610.4191409940906
  —He’s dead nuts on sales, M’Coy said295.4661318389985
 There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails3209.4297731380807
 Astronomy it was about288.3268515996998
  Lenehan laughed153.6645598829658
  —I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said1087.5421260674161
 Come over in the sun394.4005821851162
  They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall798.7225617638572
  Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks5549.391087818443
  —There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly4460.860245149918
 The annual dinner, you know253.0914446095182
 Boiled shirt affair171.72763342222646
 The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music16130.267055746648
 Bartell d’Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard193.18949772374302

5.2325521685823055
  —I know, M’Coy broke in229.05372836100685
 My missus sang there once164.59429579275846
  —Did she? Lenehan said221.38925464851104
  A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street385.66181558356334
  He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh648.688343268462
  —But wait till I tell you, he said535.8116366875081
 Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher238.11993344457628
 Bloom and the wife were there754.4583725751058
 Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice370.6560815182638
 Fast and furious it was339.5539866159783
 After liquids came solids157.67787167306236

  Lenehan linked his arm warmly244.11872155820922
  —But wait till I tell you, he said535.8116366875081
 We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the morning after the night before6037.498518350379
 Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s night on the Featherbed Mountain3062.0529334371454
 Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other320161.0140143574
 We started singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_295.88266870240847
 She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband336.85178634205806
 Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me388.2243110002159
 Hell’s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her946.4628447943215
 Like that97.4089930681231
  He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:  —I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time9501.321604562665
 Know what I mean?  His hands moulded ample curves of air649.8858770095508
 He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips779.4229739589019
  —The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh6349.815637371167
 She’s a gamey mare and no mistake213.89600781346087
 But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way128171.75627590019
 He knows them all, faith458.2567471051983
 At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away265.7724279101089
 _And what star is that, Poldy?_ says she871.6936790577255
 _That one, is it?_ says Chris Callinan, _sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick17874.730707349998
_ By God, he wasn’t far wide of the mark1094.7303899682445
  Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter363.5507295296898
  —I’m weak, he gasped187.5286740909326
  M’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave347.3746525899405
 Lenehan walked on again239.0374554820836
 He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly192.12110420089283
 He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy220.57332580864386
  —He’s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously3294.0118402442104

  He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch786.8430434077334
  The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter467.8811326795669
  —Them are two good ones, he said429.85925193550537
  Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth2112.7893374199484
 He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain6125.610354236198
  On O’Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c757.0434709485181

  Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman851.0929457218184

  Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains709.0037062186502
 The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing411.5373928021899
 He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor311.0194472764136
 He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired3931.194352557721
  Mr Bloom beheld it162.35357018232943
  Mastering his troubled breath, he said:  —I’ll take this one35186.12624035467

  —It’s time for you, she said815.3977257961715
  —Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said1143.088503340456
 Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder? Melancholy God!  Dilly shrugged her shoulders552.3471403257707
 Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back887.2709967349139
  —Stand up straight, girl, he said281.90916317748804
 You’ll get curvature of the spine172.88613762047098
 Do you know what you look like?  He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw1944.9001433900532
  —Give it up, father, Dilly said1467.4701482038292
 All the people are looking at you499.71326633937616
  Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache338.4282304105535
  —Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said528.0750976598564
 There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence214.24893175955862
  —You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes1676.1297295754287
  —How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek22231.692011469324
  Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James’s street403.1384326314212
  —I know you did, Dilly answered696.2698924354004
 Were you in the Scotch house now?  —I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling966401.0006888717
 Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy? Here1691.5827786434565
  He handed her a shilling196.28366642186012
  —See if you can do anything with that, he said4134.398396924186
  —I suppose you got five, Dilly said368.90229685476226
 Give me more than that392.13140615539646
  —Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly1604.1767571024402
 You’re like the rest of them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died27512.475245303063
 You’ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me305.82850437127865
 Low blackguardism! I’m going to get rid of you2423.05959645746
 Wouldn’t care if I was stretched out stiff545.8328375920576
 He’s dead154.83881912946924
 The man upstairs is dead162.30985514797985
  He left her and walked on469.0692905119583
 Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat208.8902525437952
  —Well, what is it? he said, stopping90132.11059345663
  The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs161.37364268590704
  —Barang!  —Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him5706.668620455067
  The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly:  —Bang!  Mr Dedalus stared at him2223.3150264515702
 It’s instructive159.0932398360252
 I wonder will he allow us to talk312.153216598592
  —You got more than that, father, Dilly said841.8997374749268
  —I’m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said5833.584537175122
 I’ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews235.12972425865885
 Look, there’s all I have236.53123624079112
 I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral527.3228921656572
  He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously464.00424302997493
  —Can’t you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said304.56153679412114
  Mr Dedalus thought and nodded180.4321871239469
 I looked all along the gutter in O’Connell street418.82665854833465
 I’ll try this one now177.08298338410611
  —You’re very funny, Dilly said, grinning598.5861594943631
  —Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies2483.4544378990654
 Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something826.2944748922429
 I’ll be home shortly168.24943213843653
  He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on2081.397592140624
  The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate1018.733693101989
  —I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said296.00312472460973
  The lacquey banged loudly150.36661346038497
  Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently:  —The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn’t do anything! O, sure they wouldn’t really! Is it little sister Monica!  *    *    *   From the sundial towards James’s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James’s street, past Shackleton’s offices5751306.197377585
 Got round him all right280.1311774472344
 How do you do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir884.6901568366314
 I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico830.6849739532213

 Men trampling down women and children305.85574150103815
 Most brutal thing157.6444738872532
 What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion281.64080180670885
 Most scandalous revelation164.2163792365952
 Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst207.99731679148857

 You know why? Palm oil183.24230507941772
 Is that a fact? Without a doubt489.7743352383597
 Well now, look at that1281.6465067998731
 And America they say is the land of the free1624.081471961445

 Well, of course, where there’s money going there’s always someone to pick it up1163.65141840147
  Saw him looking at my frockcoat292.84177831573714
 Dress does it169.67051745463687
 Nothing like a dressy appearance260.42906141736114

 Stylish coat, beyond a doubt264.0487920192053

  Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness’s visitors’ waitingroom3363.5499667437807
 Outside the Dublin Distillers Company’s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel335.21309416407223
 Damn dangerous thing155.58259446294312

 Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails207.8185831048759
 Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones295.6592617964862
  Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness10203.700794134878

 A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance223.415599815934
  —With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked3064.540758962444
  —The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered2942.6136121405116
 Reuben of that ilk252.98174094315402
 I’m just waiting for Ben Dollard203.9360496924731
 He’s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off7273.47929076111
 All I want is a little time390.5839018015785
  He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck6630.26664757487
  —I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding1569.3076060416915
 Poor old bockedy Ben! He’s always doing a good turn for someone297.67411411400303
 Hold hard!  He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant1730.0883600928016
  —There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets20121.288989991262
  Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge505.7698680707503
  As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:  —Hold that fellow with the bad trousers1733.5673265210155
  —Hold him now, Ben Dollard said586.7407111201056
  Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard’s figure251.76962347292306
 Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:  —That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?  —Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw3741623.483565476
  He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:  —They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow346630.12433091993
  —Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said654.1482303315594
 Thanks be to God he’s not paid yet420.4230043695488
  —And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked706.7850520891363
  Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club1938.6209437446357
  Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth a deep note325.07279960353657
  —Aw! he said289.7878257734865
  —That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone2395.914070028569
  —What about that? Ben Dollard said540.121488699431
 Not too dusty? What?  He turned to both4264.193362926258
  —That’ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also2281.5097017148505
  The reverend Hugh C147.96860680232734
 Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles1728.9747155315968
  Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air1476.482514634662
  —Come along with me to the subsheriff’s office, he said1644.6599347107565
 I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff1083.6576955722232
 He’s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun160.80199771834668
 He’s well worth seeing, mind you340.9146635894141
 Come along155.82791477787634
 I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don’t3616.438504566513
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
 Wait awhile164.8381152829768
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
 We’re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me1206.6899851634503
  —For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously4261.1441712076
  Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright3340.427891216498
  —What few days? he boomed206.28260454008156
 Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?  —He has, Father Cowley said1027.7362283972864
  —Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben Dollard said632.0442895385457
 The landlord has the prior claim156.6835639548392
 I gave him all the particulars681.4122430208945
 29 Windsor avenue160.35066545240826
 Love is the name?  —That’s right, Father Cowley said5609.915206453618
 The reverend Mr Love253.42153572186476
 He’s a minister in the country somewhere382.20916823322233
 But are you sure of that?  —You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts804967.44847444
  He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk290.02203714237197
  —Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them140671.9365260154
  The policeman touched his forehead183.8376484407162
  He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street546.8307568555284
  Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel3430.1062033111375
  —Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard1414.356714012206
 I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him1159.3359482757357
  —You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward1633.1455200281305
 Touch me not175.56137520726736
  John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill934.1213216930206
  On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending2164.438121808018
  The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street272.3417978716715
  —Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_ office9546.350557466623
 I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings412.21705691886075
  —Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list4889.358512734595
 And put down the five shillings too257.48372363529865
  —Without a second word either, Mr Power said490.6189596238579
  —Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added766.5032043194672
  John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes284.81890159437273
  —I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly417.1075356401932
  They went down Parliament street250.18929073976406
  —There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s1715.7366626904038
  —Righto, Martin Cunningham said247.09757945017836
 Here goes105.16648333518556
  Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties1119.0331245527182
  John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches8451.931691067775
  —The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power2161.536172936007
  They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms610.7737094191837
 The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate237.49668925596603
 Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance675.130922990817
  —And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life14612.481988174499
  The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood1320.7938818242503
  —Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted9229.708137554948
  Long John Fanning made no way for them438.65877667707656
 He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces508.3168149512079
  —Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk4250.3213588609515
  Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language644.7537373079679
 Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber13049.266946005291
 And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him178310.85509987627
 Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers433.582140932646
  Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips599.8467896075749
  Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace32546.167782134027
  —What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked1177.40540612119
  Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot319.2452603943301
  —O, my corns! he said plaintively2256.82469169208
 Come upstairs for goodness’ sake till I sit down somewhere349.15618329274884
 Uff! Ooo! Mind!  Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and passed in and up the stairs792.1064103584273
  —Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff3840.243780280031
 I don’t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though1072.2693146069407
  With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in1199.7084681878923
  —Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror327021.24097534956
  Long John Fanning could not remember him310.85685483022246
  Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air284.0810980443767
  —What’s that? Martin Cunningham said384.6107545234207
  All turned where they stood187.06817233773342
 John Wyse Nolan came down again293.0239541256937
 From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering3002.2473362858286
 Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly449.86328510951574
 In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders264.120961033931
  —What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase39232.90430683467
  —The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot4661.039737576035
  *    *    *   As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines:  —Parnell’s brother875.4870857367717
 There in the corner558.9025931986682
  They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard2407.0828480501937
  —Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat1543.6442038929863
  —Yes, Mulligan said234.6667503871205
 That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal400.87520000919955
  John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested2722.088695268818
 An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner1611.8254313963516
  —I’ll take a _mélange,_ Haines said to the waitress2303.6001243939536
  —Two _mélanges,_ Buck Mulligan said352.9630572790986
 And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well592.1637605588918
  When she had gone he said, laughing:  —We call it D33239.14151124729
B29.91333695865214
C22.206977252098767
 because they have damn bad cakes196.05890386667681
 O, but you missed Dedalus on _Hamlet331.59770545662786
_  Haines opened his newbought book178.6448906385666
  —I’m sorry, he said355.27891433970643
 Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance403.56712609383464
5.2325521685823055
  Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter212.43215810435655
  —You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance20607.113327061605
 Wandering Ængus I call him199.41174903324068
  —I am sure he has an _idée fixe,_ Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger9670.723412356278
 Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be1090.7816371098193
 Such persons always have167.61384460740683
  Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely232.44555726022475
  —They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell5634.010311865306
 He will never capture the Attic note289.129060336103
 The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth987.463123555374
 That is his tragedy162.74666470598152
 He can never be a poet612.3776720657279
 The joy of creation158.24943799452714
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
  —Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly1743.6470243326428
 I see79.39277149070662
 I tackled him this morning on belief478.45010411553636
 There was something on his mind, I saw3979.5208812966903
 It’s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that809.6368490187563
  Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come198.97354549465953
 He helped her to unload her tray196.07123073206438
  —He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups1976.7933323433338
 The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution761.9005463746802
 Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea332.4401913466618
 Does he write anything for your movement?  He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream369.5120557610981
 Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith241.33655293523387
 He bit off a soft piece hungrily222.42616197097277
  —Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing6289.729608382457
 He is going to write something in ten years812.8660444331156
  —Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon2102.7400051772647
 Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all998.7776573155537
  He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup255.22369200511403
  —This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance7938.003359793362
 I don’t want to be imposed on397.91484543294246
  Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks3830.5184695024473
  *    *    *   Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell’s yard952.4716117264888
 Behind him Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith’s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square1699.3327824196372
 Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park3623.634104728598
  Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling4125.755015469679
  At the corner of Wilde’s house he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke’s lawn3593.032868782211
 His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun251.36000684557754
 With ratsteeth bared he muttered:  —_Coactus volui939.6383717296795
_  He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word340.23614605711526
  As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body475.58681305847955
 The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form216.2454981896128
  —God’s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You’re blinder nor I am, you bitch’s bastard!  *    *    *   Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling37277145.24118082
 It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s18461.67837039342
 And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing252.3679450477775
  After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him689.5155699149103
 He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props686.7121554969057
 From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently171.04074097836155
 Myler Keogh, Dublin’s pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns1734.208488210704
 Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see329.2109786483569
 Myler Keogh, that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash2938.5065000372174
 I could easy do a bunk on ma199.55604732591186
 Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned490.2033190073609
 That’s me in mourning201.40150128302147
 When is it? May the twentysecond1725.085574893362
 Sure, the blooming thing is all over251.72687444349222
 He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up23593.51666129706
 Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers10567.606590453734
 One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out132764.33316621272
  Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on219.60358828876286
 The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons262.7503052250191
 One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man6367.238774310902
 But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all2433.1438636695084
  In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time31182.842264768624
  No Sandymount tram160.59032920401108
  Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand452.80471509277476
 His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down380.1294650952875
 The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it466.59293764661635
 He met schoolboys with satchels162.45137822039126
 I’m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday197.00990157766802
 He met other schoolboys160.0793629123961
 Do they notice I’m in mourning? Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight1618.2870143684947
 Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s name14609.25880802807
  His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye37737.127085395805
 The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs9818.66240056263
  Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend4898.057775028361
 A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking936.7636142161898
 Never see him again157.75116855451068
 Death, that is935.6177324595809
 Pa is dead164.16913692866976

 I couldn’t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better5766.622219611509
 Poor pa155.61250443824005
 That was Mr Dignam, my father236.59321707194172

 They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes5636.771816177866
  Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down2869.8027435429017
  Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled385.1701656321947
 Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes392.211984494113
 With his bit of beard!  Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation2008.2830878195357
  —Married to the greasy nose! she yelled234.34160512444558
  Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter743.8949542301044
 And then laughed more162.27905797365534

 You’re very simple, I don’t think513.4805362919

 I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon345.8110392793848
  —You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer3681.061779748587
 And what did the doctor order today?  —Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself21397.026972976535

  With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane’s she turned herself447.81428792956086
 With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg234.78261304451604
 Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe1147.3538106313224
 Alacrity she served166.7749483918222
 He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes187.6126458324835

  Lenehan came forward176.79675574681093
  —Was Mr Boylan looking for me?  He asked671.3518543931377
 She answered:  —Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?  She asked2746.68545427342
 Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page:  —No534.5451114182375

 Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?  He droned in vain516.6777409381111
 Miss Douce turned to her tea aside212.0198821928472
  He sighed aside:  —Ah me! O my!  He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod1456.2260311994974
  —Greetings from the famous son of a famous father908.7850359913216

  —I see, he said289.2407080875704
 I didn’t recognise him for the moment836.5045030558757
 I hear he is keeping very select company184.22722301630264
 Have you seen him lately?  He had548.5224846922872

_ He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse375.5931203685866
  He smiled at bronze’s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:  —The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips8204.610667410801

  —The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player9314.729962758842

 How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?  —Soot’s luck, says Joe5328.9286408594335
 Who’s the old ballocks you were talking to?  —Old Troy, says I, was in the force29184.08218327058
 I’m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders1517.2193811924649

 There’s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God’s quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street3020316.796359827

  —Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease5208.42778263523
 I want to give the citizen the hard word about it660.3143514288194
  So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another1904.0243797834546
 Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it1002.8215728950801
 Jesus, I couldn’t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber546.2836246525433
 For trading without a licence, says he452.9252747907017
  In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan1809.1003520038555
 There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar270.2121297436232
 There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown309.65665341465666
 A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated4515.731545326842
 In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied9760.195953143344
 Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects12849.49073155558
 And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan’s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings61059.270927133075
  And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains5882.974893974236
 Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes54667.453181236786
  I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him12344.896182252418
 Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!  And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun566577941.4337342
  So we turned into Barney Kiernan’s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink7479078.506528904
  —There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause76052.90465934802
  The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps3836.5450948331413
 Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog1407.7870690914442
 I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence3690.661223091564
  —Stand and deliver, says he347.50357352972685
  —That’s all right, citizen, says Joe1246.4698592474413
 Friends here168.75664325049104
  —Pass, friends, says he282.44947605163696
 But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion1046.0853406428873
  —I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork4768.0241237037635
  So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:  —Foreign wars is the cause of it3057.142714062408
  And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:  —It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise8390.379941903968
  —Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I292.3810702455458
 I’ve a thirst on me I wouldn’t sell for half a crown325.7868672579224
  —Give it a name, citizen, says Joe584.6600003990758
  —Wine of the country, says he1110.8244349611693
  —What’s yours? says Joe192.5223866650912
  —Ditto MacAnaspey, says I203.90182141715425
  —Three pints, Terry, says Joe382.7540026052461
 And how’s the old heart, citizen? says he459.9547524005639
 What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?  And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him1366724.8928428923
  The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero12495.010177756943
 From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_)83186.06926017624
 The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest6959.757536220688
 The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower1373.2405209498204
 A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble13549.133236312562
  He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes852.9300966503972
 Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut222.59773135326162
 His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast1815.0878949832534
 From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O’Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O’Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O’Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M’Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S9727.969061031612

 A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone77711.2054543783
  So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid3305.2508147850754
 O, as true as I’m telling you478.28714230745754

  And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race120970.31705689215
  Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney’s snug, squeezed up with the laughing5426.063562292781
 And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran8849.678805912581

 The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man16375.278717116838
  —When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe642.6795523164922
  —Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up816.1471986083717

  —Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran276.83972410387577
 Is that Bergan?  —Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf1124.3497152988882
  Terence O’Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda5115.542904254653
 For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat2431.4177054672796
  Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals19516.54979262007
  But he, the young chief of the O’Bergan’s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze1989.1999103975104
 Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop3311851862.8395944
  —What’s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?  —What’s that? says Joe16982.475843883618
  —Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino1871.7706590553182

 Hangmen’s letters166.51412971056163
 Look at here122.78108231415112
  So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket4862.284093245202
  —Are you codding? says I191.92590907654227
  —Honest injun, says Alf232.50830765687374
 Read them164.72093498859488
  So Joe took up the letters273.53395251611755
  —Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran276.83972410387577
  So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust64034.13913197467
 I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam1415.2274430666712

  —Is it Paddy? says Joe376.88578770004926

 He’s no more dead than you are449.08416416827407
  —Maybe so, says Joe311.2920615288947
 They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow411.88650489519273
  —Paddy? says Alf245.01833771165366
  —Ay, says Joe108.34438781083517
 He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him545.7723661725286
  —Good Christ! says Alf177.3440566568773
  In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face21165.744394677084
 Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels328535.13382023695
 In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them45048.091854925005
 Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature1018456.4143761619
 Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief378.34842760717055
 Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power36242.93491568043
 It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body19183.54272196116

 O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements54819.79160601632
 Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good602123.2007730129
 He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known4677.959282178959
  Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction2643.9642003194904
  He is gone from mortal haunts: O’Dignam, sun of our morning231.58554257878777
 Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow499.3296471932591
  —There he is again, says the citizen, staring out5123.032588214062
  —Who? says I94.8208553453566
  —Bloom, says he147.95924903611294
 He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes4461.266971327946
  And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again2410.3277554079355
  Little Alf was knocked bawways173.02561227086537
 Faith, he was991.5472675951883
  —Good Christ! says he176.5790002927709
 I could have sworn it was him291.57958372322685
  And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence:  —Who said Christ is good?  —I beg your parsnips, says Alf5181221.6754924925
  —Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?  —Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off871952.6457685004
 He’s over all his troubles196.68158052163838
  But Bob Doran shouts out of him489.07281996065694
  —He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam1399.5596005308614
  Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises1676.6225933486019
 And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there417.87214157855465
  —The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character5459.418290747425
  The tear is bloody near your eye174.57792553702004
 Talking through his bloody hat194.15559934409956
 Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour3410041.211222149
  —The noblest, the truest, says he281.07283732415897
 And he’s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam5467.695280625039
  And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven2201.405626414632
  Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door597.0310676291299
  —Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen3927.1622609869764
  So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there3893.983149100184
  —O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters11623.189900511508

  —And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe299.5399591834007
 Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf17659.71226464259
 Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?  So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar4150526.2021129783
 Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake351.36373343906047
  —Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe1200.2555567824077
  And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it4435.763498977464
  —They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses12463.715329073439
  And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull73111.51681616613
  In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor1154.114376148692
 Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord837.1635491287188
  So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on438513161.2826518
  —There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf433.11340159844593
  —What’s that? says Joe106.5790303097264
  —That so? says Joe250.5641955891548
 I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible3322.66618201647
 He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker2435.411928424184
  —Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said3150.5979220077297
  —That can be explained by science, says Bloom429.98093007392805
 It’s only a natural phenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the20629.251130706256
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
  And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon4195.251145740126
  The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis70161531.37278612
_  So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other983826733.3939795
 Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought7022.955301937868
 Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs773.3166289177293
 And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get1939.7657746122352
 So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:  —Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!  Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip341716857.836133
 Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to bring14578.129378495472
 Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more8676.181070015115
 Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel411.1918826219243
  And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she’s far from the land9605.164152229478
 And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face6123.16822704796
 Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley1062.273440770041
 And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd that kept the hotel162624041.60768116
 Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat1151.9219174520051
 And Bloom with his _but don’t you see?_ and _but on the other hand_116593.1054757695
 And sure, more be token, the lout I’m told was in Power’s after, the blender’s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment6996.571267705927
 Phenomenon!  —The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom57119.198786049004
  —Ay, ay, says Joe385.3503418139187
  —You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom405.9796478528301
 What I mean is386.5050176248831
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
  —_Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen363.3202378918603
 _Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us1705.4763775934975
  The last farewell was affecting in the extreme196.8283454271227
 From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance624.6659173112503
 The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle598.0290923999963
 A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons4369.719173204882
 A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse2519.830970047993
 Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents718.8566247725585
 Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth-provoking fashion2257.2552757787057
 Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies2902.8801463138075
 The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat239900.83320513007
 The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite2297.957506918527
 The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y28451.98448575915

 All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness829.5956456895647

 In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged666.356624571433
 The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties2068.883513521241
 The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted383.27478172764233
 Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F361.8000551822955

, several of whom were bleeding profusely200.68746020823676
 Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses30962.989957485286
 The objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme767.9836377602307
  Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_9485.604264169137
 He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man705.1277347147208
 The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable418234.05382843356
 It was exactly seventeen o’clock162.65510296050496
 The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi21036.62773824386
 The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication35378.011502467176
 Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously1532.312149559285
 As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office12563.033738815247
 On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim189251.54148362274
 The housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution499.4103206411766
 Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem9758649.665362343
 The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake49662.86041602036
 The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_592.7138527597438
 Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach608.03384867556
 She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park235072.13751073045
 She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment193997.7056359542
 That monster audience simply rocked with delight171.59093746390843
 But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time782.6955363829318
 A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself2661.538116561926
 A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot93542.34612162034
 Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds45973052.47984697
 With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:  —God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart27522.49650696818
 Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way3650.786568920029
  So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland3852446.9709880315
 Antitreating is about the size of it579.8482464810429
 Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint744.3136814795147
 And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don’t be talking322298924.9490735
 Ireland sober is Ireland free165.17615716533652
 And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of4114.257704568902
 And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt7208.346120373877
  So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me17576.038216226534
 I’d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog5948.180096861606
 Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him712.0461786054727
  —Afraid he’ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering2241.5388819646614
  —No, says I220.5074358217993
  So he calls the old dog over589.2844810069215
  —What’s on you, Garry? says he942.6142466091403
  Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera93122.69461335544
 Such growling you never heard as they let off between them297.78275615656946
 Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that4137.424753770184
 Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws8999.038809766691
  All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry42075.64990807412
 The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse4145.39120851237
 Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards2371.6261265946296
 We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D1805.3726686872553
 O34.62382374524244
 points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye94857.1027282545
 We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication12228.196647655568
 The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught1494.8335985196586
 Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour1441.7447718467045
       The curse of my curses      Seven days every day      And seven dry Thursdays      On you, Barney Kiernan,      Has no sup of water      To cool my courage,      And my guts red roaring      After Lowry’s lights6678.123955350283
  So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off7372.627681524207
 And Joe asked him would he have another676.3871551598306
  —I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there’s no ill feeling6550.038234223574
  Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking204.9166273081897
 Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators1163.9671826124782
 Entertainment for man and beast194.01802966185318
 And says Joe:  —Could you make a hole in another pint?  —Could a swim duck? says I1426.77371076918
  —Same again, Terry, says Joe278.34954193334715
 Are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he6426.732615013321
  —Thank you, no, says Bloom2914.1541965152737
 As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam’s67780.99226842182
 Martin asked me to go to the house5641.726062558067
 You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy613572.4695956431
  —Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is landed24991.45145237692
 So the wife comes out top dog, what?  —Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers569653.2719770022
  —Whose admirers? says Joe176.92228255940847
  —The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom1803.2188286746248
  Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act49533736.79350179
 He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court16975.00097479286

 O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery380.0814860058963
  So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her7026962.93649722
 Choking with bloody foolery180.14501347228335
 And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that664.929163258833
 Shake hands, brother191.24173274967615
 You’re a rogue and I’m another246.16447848404604
  —Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour249716.63324059936
 But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness429.26315692942694
  —No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup30621.961188486697
  —Then suffer me to take your hand, said he1280.9510336041885
 The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech9275.235213492655
 Boosed at five o’clock181.71141475756855
 Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A396.89421667927763
 Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups5048.949063038765
 And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging11182041.886856891
 And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another238821.3103032735
 _How is your testament? Have you got an old testament?_ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what37492.44228221848
 Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady284593.5464181133
 Jack Mooney’s sister166.3447811857561
 And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples516.596334030821
 Gob, Jack made him toe the line222.0325361629236
 Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus, he’d kick the shite out of him2695.091917738048
  So Terry brought the three pints260.22826262228915
  —Here, says Joe, doing the honours3954.1354904535715
 Here, citizen167.66276204366633
  —_Slan leat_, says he398.5362849765869
  —Fortune, Joe, says I203.85161704958472
 Good health, citizen309.90920864145875
  Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already4657.466087741588
 Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks362.9878038384483
  —Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe1126.1902937912637
  —Friend of yours, says Alf380.25358103825903
  —Nannan? says Joe178.04680663408948
 The mimber?  —I won’t mention any names, says Alf2321.064641714959
  —I thought so, says Joe535.0824020699037
 I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M964.6343160620978
 P21.29545135188944
, the cattle traders247.50068873291733
  —Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own15495.4272512637
  So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue307798.7320855736
 Because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard376.2904317286713
 Walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier8593.020107515615

  —Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens587120.974566264
  —Well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight3875.5005362127745
  —That’s too bad, says Bloom447.13927038974373

 You’re sure?  —Nannan’s going too, says Joe384.1593584353564
 The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park1544.989607543805
  Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham154.7580727919353
 Nat108.82261696147798
): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?  Mr Allfours (Tamoshant151204.88292050318

 I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that291.78141148338904
 The answer to the honourable member’s question is in the affirmative684.555000592711
  Mr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte166.52702130740673
 Nat108.82261696147798
): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?  Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative20959.04587429615
  Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman’s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)  Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question20459.616274287764

 What was your best throw, citizen?  —_Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest33512.49841711915
 There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow7833.468817557542
  —Put it there, citizen, says Joe291.37987556924725
 You were and a bloody sight better213.39446506243738
  —Is that really a fact? says Alf461.19891825812067
  —Yes, says Bloom151.87682242738242
 That’s well known167.91874953236598
 Did you not know that?  So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that33295.415692542454
 And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent exercise was bad2429.1293695046115
 I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom82079.93370793383

  A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O’Ciarnain’s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of _Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race7335778.4092320595
 The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions4097.9762458692385
 After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers7843.967758157755
 The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages19157.295396490947

 The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it535.4664160099532
 His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions356430.87462310935

 After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him flat2863.7503917319846
 It was a knockout clean and clever297.2101510034522
 Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight2106.4998464804294

 No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment1535.1968329546557

  And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law3589869.467600884
 There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another2295357.5422724397
 And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer554.7649571206482
 And he sat him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin394158.06901052647
 And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true29639496279969.227
 And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book51591.92870467812
 And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness30114.099653404613
 And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received4501.32502362684
 And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor5269.860534803208
  —Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs4137.053935693526
  So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford22408.738507536444
 And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all939.6646030871733

O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael20397605272.618885

 Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world11602282.691985756

 The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral53971.90581020305

  So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:  —Or also living in different places842992.5183532008
  —That covers my case, says Joe228.74058653173745
  —What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen647.163167665751
  —Ireland, says Bloom249.42677527008192
 I was born here351.7517773991685
 Ireland150.0508021473858
  The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner139089.6449868044
  —After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry80578.29478420348
  —Here you are, citizen, says Joe404.5900822072035
 Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words959.5287513153744
  The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration1849.977284315596
 No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill356356.42364846036
 The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides8285.422329253455
 Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland’s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh’s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde’s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun’s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch’s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury’s Hotel, S521615.7107008901
 Patrick’s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley’s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal’s Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time363467.4628368007
  —Show us over the drink, says I487.46144100498174
 Which is which?  —That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman142179.25728849
  —And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted18090.52402994265

  —Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen896.0126795983281

 That’s not life for men and women, insult and hatred333.79006056997787

  —What? says Alf157.88802071770792
  —Love, says Bloom241.72946047807545
 I mean the opposite of hatred272.4059442255776

  —Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song1802.9477611893735
 More power, citizen163.70745831059168
  —Hurrah, there, says Joe625.5399035553024
  —The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen2696.2255693237985
  And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle224.1109504755679
  —We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket1875.0483430731679
 What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting England?  —What’s that? says Joe199333.05096894907
  So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:  —A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions841534.981646512
 The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor44413099793.9001
 The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands590542.2893560429
  —Widow woman, says Ned346.46215219111167
 I wouldn’t doubt her162.47518508179138
 Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would574.7806113761503
  —Same only more so, says Lenehan832.0844622217107
 And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly206.4042936171647
  —Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse261.83251104352894
  —No, says the citizen242.65752513260819
 It’s not signed Shanganagh164.33924749544423
 It’s only initialled: P160.93420404534044
  —And a very good initial too, says Joe629.5420068942359
  —That’s how it’s worked, says the citizen243.33036028961843

 Did you read that report by a man what’s this his name is?  —Casement, says the citizen6780.883285334846
 He’s an Irishman164.22310677895516
  —Yes, that’s the man, says J1575.023299705994

  —I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers1344.807672524453
  —Who? says I94.8208553453566
  —Bloom, says he147.95924903611294
 The courthouse is a blind202.91601074631785
 He had a few bob on _Throwaway_ and he’s gone to gather in the shekels14512.154594874688
  —Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?  —That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan38776.259757721906
 I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip21296.88501768697
 Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on3813.0580213082835
 He’s the only man in Dublin has it440.67185406515085
 A dark horse234.40153675987494
  —He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe355.5799230654069
  —Mind, Joe, says I220.56636416714457
 Show us the entrance out194.41462458417524
  —There you are, says Terry827.3543109527802
  Goodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort444.09189541528593
 So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery’s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she’s better_ or _she’s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there’s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos14836233850903.764
  So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries1051805.1050932414

  —Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse731.9942589716198
 And there’s the man now that’ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham24185.790388997248
  Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king’s expense182103.14799321606
  Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys204.5930267013707
  —Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party1381.6482161926465
  Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard582.5787982466966
  —Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow1860.020576950429
  —Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked418.2396838057171
 Look to our steeds177.80217545297594
 And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it392.7962166014008
  —Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder2791.293067236887
 I know not what to offer your lordships286.97855432024465
  —How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun?  An instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage28389.856918013447
  —Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly4418.6800360160305
 An you be the king’s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught846.6178821699224
 The king’s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me922.0108579069403
  —Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect706.006196340641
 Hast aught to give us?  Mine host bowed again as he made answer:  —What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?  —Gadzooks! cried the last speaker164041.17512583727
 That likes me well171.4871652163584
 Pistachios!  —Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance752.3056708985112
 A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’Tis a merry rogue599.8500968850271
  So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom199.4670592735836
  —Where is he? says Lenehan486.7847992910774
 Defrauding widows and orphans172.19492189788787
  —Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?  —That’s so, says Martin215817.09006285729
 Or so they allege164.92761482752385
  —Who made those allegations? says Alf191.7032880712616
  —I, says Joe220.19108408195936
 I’m the alligator144.97470718115787
  —And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like the next fellow?  —Why not? says J55285.11197853865
 J14.055315956249904
, when he’s quite sure which country it is244.6462111495403
  —Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned4642.219473380918
 Or who is he? No offence, Crofton2370.720665690488
  —Who is Junius? says J196.4368755333347
 J14.055315956249904
  —We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian1171.3426582511058
  —He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system453354.06608248537
 We know that in the castle745.5555140742675
  —Not at all, says Martin989.8386029565271
 Only namesakes152.50683180783233
 His name was Virag, the father’s name that poisoned himself723.7765044551431
 He changed it by deedpoll, the father did452.8924447931865
  —That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen285.72902835937043
 Island of saints and sages!  —Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin4388.696055038216
 For that matter so are we394.8195526480123
  —Yes, says J83.88668675598375
 J14.055315956249904
, and every male that’s born they think it may be their Messiah1235.1871985336861
 And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he’s a father or a mother3444.909206337271
  —Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan341.7654184416804
 I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered2321.8436170773975
  —_En ventre sa mère_, says J591.078894511489
  —Do you call that a man? says the citizen1523.0718650897343
  —I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe5696.618193392779
  —Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power698.4828008496155
  —And who does he suspect? says the citizen291.43995349087385
 One of those mixed middlings he is334.2287822506178
 Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses16484.25380353696

 But where is he? We can’t wait946.9809087913579

  And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S24860260471.37695

 And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns7720.333542720791
 And as they wended their way by Nelson’s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying241887.47698329983
 And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O’Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick1083.9898334104137
 And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein160403454.35087514
 And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers3772.6529062677155

_  And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:  —_Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum55359.10845358666

  —Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey5667.192373125146
  The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard2930.7214129178055
 A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair86290.91868340537
 Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters567.4376945301957
  But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him683700589.4459519
  —Let me alone, says he279.3627755974411
  And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:  —Three cheers for Israel!  Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake and don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself3573504.426998629

  And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her:  —Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!  And says he:  —Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza73589874944083.2

  A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters)93564.19855909333
 The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality343.32835311888044
 An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob108560.82876491535
 The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_, followed immediately by _Rakóczsy’s March_4465.232524630555
 Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M’Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom26582.32733901233
 Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light332363.48984452925
 _Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra!_ Gone but not forgotten236.84259451692165
  Gob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s royal theatre:  —Where is he till I murder him?  And Ned and J31606868.726788472

  —Bloody wars, says I, I’ll be in for the last gospel14501.827412491695
  But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other way and off with him3080.0493883107038
  —Hold on, citizen, says Joe286.3949350683298
 Stop!  Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly1494.2783461994486
 Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he’d have left him for dead6849.585331050651
 Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford810.6448410234187
 The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street42293.21939219865
  The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect210.12056035548454
 The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas98755.31275792526
 The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch13809.655236723544
 All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive616505.7319219263
 From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character388.4276635954692
 An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale13445321.276912292
 Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west351.0907904834748
 Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst680165.7558586907
 The work of salvage, removal of _débris,_ human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T3393.3590969267902

 The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses829.1907707535189
 What? O, Jesus, he did2899.738538807792
 And he let a volley of oaths after him315.5299956488751
  —Did I kill him, says he, or what?  And he shouting to the bloody dog:  —After him, Garry! After him, boy!  And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb584500267.6069548
 Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you67551.01179618422
  When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven2171.835575983472
 And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him86020.06284085345
 And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah! Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai!_ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe’s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel3355525.9378415896
     [ 13 ]   The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace410.45634530202165
 Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea8234988752.582114
  The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly2956.127967641273
 Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H1475059.1206638757

 For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them2254.608382709573
 They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long1874.3110742533427
 And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight4052.730876265202
 He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words1877.7390627078998
 Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin1038.6156062512543

  And baby prattled after her:  —A jink a jink a jawbo2642.6033225308042
  Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on46749.561717447774
 What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib16171.39733745253
 None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey568.982945508091
 A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme32014.52912335276
 And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother597.5509398718841
  But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky2565.876768296198
 Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule589.7318201859035
 The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had44603.29150403292
 But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too4469.2590078380335
 Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends1774.689790416492
  —Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively507.735100952845
 At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand947.2844869709089
 Wait till I catch you for that284.94126928920156
  His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins344.4397626165111
 And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure1412.815127015476
 His little man-o’-war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit13217.017305802998
 Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition34422.97972958673
  —Nasty bold Jacky! she cried241.40011341752515
  She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:  —What’s your name? Butter and cream?  —Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman5016.528901365294
 Is Cissy your sweetheart?  —Nao, tearful Tommy said538.1815349184707
  —Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried289.2175521721981
  —Nao, Tommy said186.5018687073379
 I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart267.55996367048493
 Gerty is Tommy’s sweetheart155.56468641328274
  —Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears750.3221401038415
  Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes7640.041262358281
  But who was Gerty?  Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see3832.1514676028087
 She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell1277.6865929779844
 Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling41427.82460275545
 Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either50049.06041148779
 Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again20537646.17584562
 No30.4117530355444
 Honour where honour is due188.04408253160355
 There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep896.3922524101915
 Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her612717.8767341195
 Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist26686.472840313305
 Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows585.8045818400974
 Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive233.80557241677715
 It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it38377.55559975541
 Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one25279.04733430738
 But Gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair210.45862479076752
 It was dark brown with a natural wave in it346.5452805603603
 She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth26437.410047668738
 And just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal3804.754600403221
  For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes686.987661914279
 She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue671.6993652612981
 Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent1279.3181228084393
 The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning5035.628901712018
 As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window71859.02075400682
 Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W1150525.564072428
 E22.00108921275723
 Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university274.2468470661559
 Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core695.7436621960007
 Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time723.996111989661
 They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph3671.2124443820826
 But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden1876181716497.679
  Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out36591.74136643416
 A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady’s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection3473349.121736251
 She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone4381.990690910694
 All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny4461.318921251559
 Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep66308.9628550842
 Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops4458.121038200534
 As for undies they were Gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things123082386.74095142
 She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a Friday22512486672.67641
  And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time1405.086420893328
 Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror29762183.022416066
 You are lovely, Gerty, it said416.1254697541359
 The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful249.30325435152798
 Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain166.06922546324623
 Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T3283.2907652315926
 C22.206977252098767
 D29.19021952170794
 (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be10516.306482935126
 He was too young to understand408.15459076716536
 He would not believe in love, a woman’s birthright829.2640616922528
 The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips79558.16034703141
 He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments1243641.6326849493
 Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men4147.734886472606
 But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over4401.669532304869
 No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss2935157.5536130657
 It would be like heaven299.1363922594723
 For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve223.1518435696184
 With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward26962.169219231764
  And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be6138.7108191743155
 Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November23805.171527529124
 She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess872.652050603657
 Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses34536477.35317181
 He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes21487488.750849456
  Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight58532.59845600083
 But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please64004077.6818435
 The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies188471.5288289736
 Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him120537.53868211457
  —You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said220.93533595115736
 It’s my ball162.22935284526687
  But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day11700.648050018512
  —Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss270.12484477793225
  And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin23065.48853473884
 But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him789.534084041921
  —I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t say85261.43202261045
  —On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily194.25459547400777
  Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said1746604.5603751235
 But not a pin cared Ciss212.95195564864733
  —Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose9586.266453683065
 Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at him29986.49188476994
  Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls193.85274249485943
 You had to laugh at her sometimes441.258347934939
 For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White274175.18639138015
 That was just like Cissycums320.5884275249436
 O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette7608.441006899717
 There was none to come up to her for fun655.9881932004588
 But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome19529.799822035875
  And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ3121.646729608619
 It was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S926.2279279522588
 J14.055315956249904
, rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament740.7255053868538
 They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins1748783.3895640834
 How sad to poor Gerty’s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none2731.9428607307536
 But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days293.0160695770591
 Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low598542506.9373139
  And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful312.90433620487227
 And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk31221.853472980038
 Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke53643047.875079215
 No-one would have thought the end was so near376.82637254904085
 Now he was laid to rest198.5410908510089
 And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home2988509231.6052823
  A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold19645.40672833705
 And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff59767.829322687736
 Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways411.90587211060495
 It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window42151625.853099085
 You could see there was a story behind it1282.4605629015052
 The colours were done something lovely175.71167453216378
 She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat2706.3239073600625
 She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant115947.5425952545
  The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks16281.666695179923
 Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball1435.9415851926456
 The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock3658.3000084556425
 The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed168566.2262580608
  —If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said303.6278794946261
  Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip169.0581542213434
 A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle230315.9433353439
 Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking16523.252969394227
 She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks1112.9149230155629
 Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen553788.3692606178
  Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose2058487.9220312145
 And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her1508261.8089546117
  The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers242.56592740832
 Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air306.3244604931307
 Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa103396.20260252841
 Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa802.1570233625743
  And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said10596847.119473785
  —Haja ja ja haja167.49951400920435
  Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him297172.911972605
 Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:  —Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa1200.333915121681
  And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks233.29261684158794
 It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased266804.79016750125
  Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins303670.04935216345
 She gazed out towards the distant sea350.17251811720183
 It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft319491886.6667445
 And while she gazed her heart went pitapat200.13008457970489
 Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look37530.90037730364
 His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul1139.3271003706914
 Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer814.6610874511218
 She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting671624177.434097
 He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face98566.4008353739
 She would have given worlds to know what it was2548.425417172979
 He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down698098.3036980231
 She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away6611.516238565434
 Here was that of which she had so often dreamed1125.343655410059
 It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else84062.94673808766
 The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him14779.32265165852
 If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not93193.38788892367
 Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her5258.160295918385
 There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm180.3788958710665
 She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past827650.0115401329
 Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone103320.8351169088
  Refuge of sinners170.02371366581312
 Comfortress of the afflicted200.17921691512686
 _Ora pro nobis_229.18442740153188
 Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart10584.39058267654
 Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down772492.619572484
 He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic19583.375502138093
 He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word160125815066746.5
 He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place3145642904.18082
  The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it5433.168062758367
 Little monkeys common as ditchwater168.45878191807878
 Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them6114.671656846447
 And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned4426.633938897723
  —Jacky! Tommy!  Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out53385.95886163768
 She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it825268.3848262157
 She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible21933361802691.125
 It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble15213.232390837302
 _Tableau!_ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness10671.715742085664
  Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_4533879174188346.0
 Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself36348779.327948995
  Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature3293725.9056364386
 Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness21018.247947250078
 You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that3996.8685448585998
 She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve2774.181536256243
 She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes12440.258467990594
 He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey316.35851411596923
 Her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose42656.99651124536
  Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby14201.358017027153
 Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers16780.069373273243
 And she said to Gerty:  —A penny for your thoughts3346.085531343516
  —What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth626.1512576177845
 I was only wondering was it late260.8921058221243
  Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late39223.89533924721
 And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again25263.155107892057
 But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early3615.37292272596
  —Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum626.2477554797474
  So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church598169.2183760499
 Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself10363.582370119848
 One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure276858.96131188225
  Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set173836084.40087932
 His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones8823.733425829514
 Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order2086.269551254572
 It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets737785982.4509466
 She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon6067335.545166631
 His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine618.0827430114834
 If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face4828.778328055749
 It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it5100.195723274964
  Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over141145181078350.8
 Gerty winced sharply153.87701696754755
 A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable287.36497481136877
 It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was2967.700787202838
 Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of1729.4087227343794
 She had loved him better than he knew413.8607228860251
 Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears445528.90639804234
  —O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up5365.8574358197575
 I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year255.16770827090983
  Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily584.5663822287295
 There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with12225.235513526693
 As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces307443.2000718859
 And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot9103.146995657258
 Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it291864942.73517245
  Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior113500.96042634886
 And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib3633085.1457809433
  —O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss261.4038398846208
 He has his bib destroyed236.2933031968336
  The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights616.2875768633742
  Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands3339050879.0305767
  How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry1778000.0451712268
 And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales33362119.49819989
 For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of222.86469599152363
 She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean605316.4853237976
 It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs7814747.546612505
 _Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it40558919.402762584
 But it must end, she felt227.2724366199414
 If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her3601.5547715556454
 Love laughs at locksmiths160.7165968113002
 She would make the great sacrifice207.49147786332128
 Her every effort would be to share his thoughts222.84889796912492
 Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness1449.1948742962109
 There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind2941213.092522055
 But even if—what then? Would it make a very great difference? From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled3188.793289027945
 She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station51146.73055455531
 No, no: not that517.605921496977
 They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess5946.198936674476
 Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall6282.101551851617
 She thought she understood267.6973047705461
 She would try to understand him because men were so different269.57797251018593
 The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes726.7262534944957
 Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide4637977.977732907
 Nothing else mattered166.96071143063858
 Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free377.46866698115497
  Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:  —O, look, Cissy!  And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple2820013344.837507
  —It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said208.8253787812664
  —Come on, Gerty, Cissy called535.5001038734648
 It’s the bazaar fireworks172.33818125913783
  But Gerty was adamant182.24297757201964
 She had no intention of being at their beck and call227.20297592842917
 If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was2297.5981298530505
 The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling295.72770058430706
 She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her5486.446536372586
 Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his3403.7620590082706
 At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips17072.811080943145
 His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her344.66625921383724
 She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed12373220824431.654
 But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips48223.95620993266
 Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did234895867.95928025
  And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark257249113405.13123
 And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking6.255716190646113e+18
 She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages142014.77341799348
 And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!  Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent73089055.26770934
 Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl2252.4360013284904
 He was leaning back against the rock behind222.80302488048196
 Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes695.5607668312856
 What a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered263239702.2053942
 Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no777.7961374513735
 That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell56782.08675829284
  Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried:  —Gerty! Gerty! We’re going5492.830885068052
 Come on157.08634960251408
 We can see from farther up225.96101175198172
  Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses701.122928543443
 She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back2311.875582416144
 Wonder if he’s too far to268.9278265348422
 She rose147.40423800899853
 Was it goodbye? No172.6695081805368
 She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve54652.13705234432
 She drew herself up to her full height432.1828201352332
 Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face5357.665322075505
 She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted2908.9947036197445
  Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman4830.390632769057
 It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed1242.381778031881
 She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell was1975.462386777168

  Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa!  Universally that person’s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind’s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature’s incorrupted benefaction204313.06734583562
 For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature’s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution’s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?  It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured81769384016.50221

 He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring309.45138096857215

  The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed5459.371527453695
 She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman’s birth1350.3472835977404
 Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house11122.433676246947
 The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid111674.2775759537

  And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat5862.492719984498
 And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon322.75612683649547
 And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice9550297.973231927
 And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there4484.423909197317
 And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile16561.218319210348
 Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility519.226209376918
 But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle25583.546281484865
 And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery4178.253412792579
  And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment23031.840152674198
 And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously3204.3787376328182
 And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles2952.775166321325
 And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer887.2419520658657
 And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress954.9375892743005
 And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain29824.24104495342
 And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead40925.16013636183
  And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each688.3024770756319
 And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile4352.727122472155
 And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile2673.2881685923276
 Thanked be Almighty God173.50489084991963
  This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast44858.53193986491
 Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now41287.5947789993
 Meseems it dureth overlong168.49741324336478
 And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently827879.1525813611
 But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long3581.343015863424
 And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next426.4801111955264
 Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness21009266.147058714
 And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup6771304.574761942
 Woman’s woe with wonder pondering187.67405135753475
  Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might795.2436273439951
 There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold4019177824.7818985
 But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow1490.4510269391033
 And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner13551.83223041072
 Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave385.1036213415482
  For they were right witty scholars182.3215147125708
 And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case)854941.7336126592
 And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die80514.18953687268
 And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy5148.2295197072735
 A redress God grant165.0376637809455
 This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die1322.5381536186228
 In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack1247.6455493750755
 Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved43956.92632556385
 To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk447.9308078400196
 Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire2734.940344962378
 But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief225035.6987722134
 We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we254.8089651604515
 Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends197.96119378198995
 But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead43806.82196543184
 Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do438165.3871259248
 Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever67181.4697231277
 Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides92656281.24064496
 He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded34689.657100724835
 A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions6944469.620507997
 Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons631947.4463960197
  But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny11836.745599580005
 And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores845635271.4116367
  About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray16435.25480907328

  Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard9583977.880976541
 It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred605807941.988913

  To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days35889.38349377344
 Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership2377045.0584253967
 But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin9293.433809601891
 Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided306097.45193070377
 He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid’s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals29443.680440499847

 And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry539.6975297507664
 And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm16537.04477486691
 Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour6125.643308696511
 But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead3266.8454412956517
 But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne’s hall355.67161656487656
 He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon108921202.86136164
  But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words? No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away12887.550448623577
 And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either64328.14403232972
 But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle1384.7289871830997
 Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard? Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done)1770568.0827706023
 For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show18624151.202958636
 And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law25279.912912503016
 Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence3643106691823261.0
  This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her9205.410380161717
 For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild4085992.008470207
 So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer1273.3509299712705

 Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too1137.1931115433877

 All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness3003.904806711483
 But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came15608692.594275663

 Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue1413943980.906251
 ’Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king’s bible17661.437038791726

 In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how4973762.302940792
  With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk30498915.048539527
 He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat10595.4100341165
 To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip32456.437716194174
 He took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides167554.76046564206
 The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale2411.6696137905783
 Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague57874.60595427748
 But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it9776.033344905789
 There’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset2289797.365971393
 _Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too8367.430511788807
 One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge657454.3326583077
 He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him23962.873230874327
 What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he496925.59321328136
 I can scarce believe ’tis so bad, says he440.0572781955539
 And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street14172.15424573109
 I question with you there, says he454.9545141369108
 More like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue428.8318604860661
 Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns16092533.500331927
 Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing994.2547981793149
 He’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s Irish, says he965.2906801621264
 I conceive you, says Mr Dixon1655.9114977071017
 It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose19372.822865511447
 True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock65871222.73471052
 He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains198509.36484241646
 What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself55526.20976262008
 So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly88986.30642845189
 But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland783476247.9063811
 Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content36224343.78210153
 By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture10374.493412612226
 Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground7325060724.6911335
 And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders643269.1129579621
 There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in his matters, says he2396117.8245686335
 I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me52872.317936321546
 But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show6094438401.366985
 After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name256226.27286572487
 Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat594836917.2426735
 In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt1024.641227116641
 They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America1946952770.3352053
 Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:  _—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed61754.99856886274
  A man’s a man for a’ that251.75338053928107
_  Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars871571.6979212023
 Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on52675.10153590327
 Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan20146.912890867967
 Fertiliser and Incubator167.8148949858106
 Lambay Island_177.53002132780034
 His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed62784.42196511243
 Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon20127.61410249235
 I make no doubt it smacks of wenching218.0783698370776
 Come, be seated, both202.7483973947396
 ’Tis as cheap sitting as standing172.35970465582395
 Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired210286.58889361512
 It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep14061085.840216361
 To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party62191.64164557498
 He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural21893.694224250718
 Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains24391.669827504087
 The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man4498.431683297042
 For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies6941.003341360281
 After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it7337.795989957734
 They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald23465.41046197288
 His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle1597.1513366635995
 Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck1073083.8458757596
  Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced5327.667477335324
 The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour37509.527665281355
 Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place5984818621.498958
 For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a bastard56903.705838221525
 This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight606.482085095918
 The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber3075.7894824495115
  Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it170708691.085986
 _Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_1192.2768597399147
 That you may and very opportunely222.64280847581495
 There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity224.80270347954433
 But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things932044.5881288833
 With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein114467.47720096425
 Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever94203799.41566919
 I declare, I was never so touched in all my life1317.0311816128783
 God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours7177.433577314762
 A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again4736.223715879265
 Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years2324.072891246278
 But indeed, sir, I wander from the point1732.2485592091816
 How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys208.8781730086201
 Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish284.2570548934846
 Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it3170.2856092296497
 Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse742.7355087645088
 But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting7517673.0355557045
 Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak523558.13389941567
 A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world842.2751298295333
 Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch370.20877888444

 My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment69834452.24572779
 The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath312733.49848631304

 But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge1072.2363499021624
  Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company505044.94929199497
 The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry50416.89212520289
 Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled324.7690209891947
 A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you260.778287970328
 What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad’s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch4475.362051850222

 Demme, does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin373.04623242949623
 As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months964.0409164966819
 Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I’m all of a wibbly wobbly18249.321364050447
 Why, you’re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way17273.500654743762
 I knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her589.0962445546062
 The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward28062.93423546534
 Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy12981.770961583128
 I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth61317.934150132714
 I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast22033.12510734253
 I cannot away with them197.07311222480294
 What? Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours? And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne1822045.0796010136
 Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door668.7295967612463
 A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath3249422.7534846016
 Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart351140.7998991615
  To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity20674.206215627288
 The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf17949.35797805446
 But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin30872889.719476506
 To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat158301.95619191503
 Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions150402.31194097738
 To conclude, while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being4360607.328402172
  Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers528658.2025503888
 The dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron23274.864643667475
 I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her620568.1007931529
 I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon434.12770111235267
 ’Slife, I’ll be round with you406.55536905180446
 I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her1682.4746183073062
 All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household78298.21372694566
 Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest22230.101652968337
 But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together5683.569787025484
  But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so9530823895443.68
 Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate1503.6715942586177
 He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic1079396.164762668
 It ill becomes him to preach that gospel216.33303978765403
 Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life791.3694339016349
 If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him360.4777665019638
 His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce231.06534929781714
 The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative18977.33320767829
  The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born2788.081384455734
 When he had betaken himself to the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues167232.50032577306
 In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain1691.5860135776707
 The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent535.8778396404005
 Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations1220590094655.9917
 The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation320657.32701597887
 The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born7872.576817343125
 The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human4303.92685385632
 An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses43671.25980804009
 The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived237.83292798818292
 It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man9288.128420858086
 Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined47564.78790295531

 Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked _Poison892080.2217394545
_ Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin374.668345888822
 I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame5562.808277114343
 Yes, it is true291.0849895961537

 Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? My hell, and Ireland’s, is in this life604530.7647352128
 It is what I tried to obliterate my crime404.23697276879443
 Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out1240.216083503451

 Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back1035.182314175202
 An instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station at ten past eleven6934.503918363225
 He was gone223.83284143608714
 Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host530.4663969917841

 Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased191.1396030080125
 The mystery was unveiled171.1433718753518
 Haines was the third brother276.5732005587622

  What is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood89384.62166906467
 No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds4240.957259953943
 A score of years are blown away520.0959319429704
 He is young Leopold159.10184754135693
 There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself16136.46376341421
 That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother’s thought125614.77339743062
 Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins1785141774.3515415
 The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before4153508.24485375
 But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist1446.190545305104
 Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons570.6804043063651
 Who can say? The wise father knows his own child416.05464256784984

  The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived2804.2973119045787
 A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars273.8583858999668

 And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo5710.003552350214
 And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin15517.964270243758
 It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant4303.496703895415
 How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer71975.22672133245
 It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus20699.907915612122
  Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee’s time1935.6874176270935
 You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said1598.8089941661276
 Why think of them? If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life65310.33166565353
 He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent246.2892569940673
 That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father5812.67748377857
 All who wish you well hope this for you225.18369465199595

 O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him3209.5662856447034
 Have no fear189.65611430788618
 The young man’s face grew dark176.19646387560945
 All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss9480.71470592504
 He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart1386.5090646668395
 He told them of the race233.51834648009066

 Even Phyllis could not contain herself187.28224451608443
 She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her7965.549348802903
 All was lost now187.13046845152283
 Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones458.11655843257273
 Juno, she cried, I am undone2411.2979300812794

 Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh5073.628429730821
 She is not the filly that she was1378.6012112456515
 Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another534.9683072076608
 By gad, sir, a queen of them3434.1123833470947
 Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said2278.352055183725
 How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it8121.699566239724
 The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us903.0505288854264
 In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge2314.9778693626968
 But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close759.7124212409917
 A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril553.2391417357346
 She is more taking then168.02523636996332
 Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together3608.7668614555187
 And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field7982.57458144462
 Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page25782.330380194624
 The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her2850.3421470543108
 When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries694.3341526462356
 But he had been kind875.6429853575363
 In going by he had blessed us307.481349480108
 The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said288.5734546349682
 If I had poor luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely473.32688464934046
 He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label7607.416009303708
 Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence211.54616260526214

 Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law27425.302764896318
 The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation14676.122402025565
  However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all55632.545488604155
 During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance25098618.087755136
 He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn405847.795630057
 Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place132461182644.31337
  The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life1278.897528366093
 Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity188.23861475223524
 The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital1497.0500558124625
 The high hall of Horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic1076.5452375860266
 A gallant scene in truth it made198.399055487733
 Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway25508.443151638854
 There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom2207.328083002771
 Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden2192.5130195399793
 The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan2439.0742980693
 Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come1176839.268787872
  It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S1937.8604373595106
 Dedalus’ (Div112.70630275157885
 Scep108.82261696147798
) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods254.60911778070064
 Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena280.2136146748692
 The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can7239.206961174704
 There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first problem submitted by Mr L4064.191731390059
 Bloom (Pubb110.84688464355973
 Canv108.82261696147798
) regarding the future determination of sex193.26606407661194
 Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element981145918.3788081
 The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality323.0936586461681
 It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways119409.91169256884
 Mr M159.53262172823423

 by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust172.31957870071687
 These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race285127.7068687511
 Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner420776.69534008834
 Mr J159.49450824500192
 Crotthers (Disc162.05878451071294
 Bacc163.46608930784424
) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide24627.893673056693
 Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative1018.1107973123788
 In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions64647.34937311058
 An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V225.66414585150054
 Lynch (Bacc160.50432641365856
 Arith163.77729387478544
) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained333870.66556598985
 Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet’s words, give us pause122841.40624585781
 Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest16851103.224414643
 Mr S159.57541280266216
 Dedalus’ (Div112.70630275157885
 Scep108.82261696147798
) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to225786.9821436367
 For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother33330.019545727715

) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete’s allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature’s processes—the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own5008774.799933779
 At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered14335.62535845579
  Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy _accouchement272.06933184899606
_ It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor788.4161141589515
 All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped374.3005521874297
 She had146.38614031449495
 She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy617.8460074712364
 Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene719.4445771301954
 Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband9338720.870316971
 And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God’s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces6131.094509025654
 He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch15325.341146525137
 O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days35288.95614393998
 God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose7826344.109654667
 And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here222.37164502314067
 No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina258.51293577541406
 And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest50036.507078471506

 Well done, thou good and faithful servant!  There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait12423.716189021865
 He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise5184.342802639
 Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful20413.478870084473
  The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life40975.18814479687
 A scene disengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures12305.782798685263
 A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock146800.5550295286
 And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit97305.14593114906
 A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands861.9004544832268
 He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad look14093.607367701465

 But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word42761.44323790195

 He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch3957.999943381007

 Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour26775.21712377877
 I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm14274.077882974327

 A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket2121.2459866316567
 His (Stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman’s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral124873998.40982623
 But how to get there was the rub885.715747866574
 For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned7836.035908515715
 So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e1562527.7718592356
d29.19021952170794
ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found2612.2079319304994
 Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s72614426.49608013
 But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice1083416265.8926275
  This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did25656.059943730343
 So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance128772105.62911226
 So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey37868.37105897619
 As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back34081.331543613356
 They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station374121.3745959893
 Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke’s the baker’s it is said5282.922461889254
  _En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out41884068689.617905
 Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about14740021522.422665
 The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot6931613.696760427
 Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes321839.6604635706
 Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything1116.8205329395378
 You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £129273.0593213935

 d29.19021952170794
 into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically2244750.493675918
 Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs2777.300557353647
  —And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind10705.571552719166
  Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps85600.03986819225
 Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox564651.2990890006
 He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father’s, Gumley5412.506716803672
 To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge1079.4590763909775
  —Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said419.90778864529176
  A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling:  —Night!  Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment2123.6138087749073
 Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least8196.816388764744
  Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice15494.683636344134
 Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise874.870610561038
 He was the eldest son of inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer11300.679615522029
 His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot674.4798287310495
 Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen4643709.738030577
 This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley1913.9180194698747
  Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell1650.4449619141626
 Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings504.2714546071487
 His friends had all deserted him187.17785819195137
 Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions25257.865867243134
 He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God’s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do181372.58912165204
 No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish30134228.158043876
 Anyhow he was all in283.6303359729996
  —I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I’m on the rocks1388.2360970180102
  —There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher20499.564544660927
 Mr Garrett Deasy194.25110132000577
 You may mention my name173.09371440745988
  —Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man674.9693199316939
 I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh6004.036336371338
 I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers374.5495731494592
  —I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him360.61943069415304
  Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street30813.580826172947
 There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob235140.88448833744
 He was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it349.42787058664175
  Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence30183.59553783222
 However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished1799837.9919545972
 But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful114057.71437641422
 Whereas153.49905492013627
 He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing9180371.024666077
 A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation511.9891809082011
 He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact147116.04303530016
 He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect590.0667425414468
 About biscuits he dimly remembered159.3273440228508
 Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy465.5502979457032
 However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out25559.14598721487
  —Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him589.9638890431722
  And so in point of fact they turned out to be2068.2382247449023
 Stephen anyhow lent him one of them494.69995519053896
  —Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman253.6185202932205
 I’ll pay you back one time193.11950160992023
 Who’s that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker33847.36761637542
 You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there1945.840044407086
 I’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks, man3300.9922585272507
 God, you’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the Carl Rosa3802.428727055351
  Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s, bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with O’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe16571308.936960233
 Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable3747.4050444383156
 He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when3144510.4205732006
 Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity2521.019458800201
 Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether7854028604.342911
 In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning22654.703422552513
 Pretty thick that was certainly192.97077968709849
  The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite143803.95715695215
 Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:  —He is down on his luck769628.876237563
 He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman8598.084446346484
  At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:  —Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say3880026.0260046273
 Now you mention it his face was familiar to me358.6971763884738
 But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?  —Half a crown, Stephen responded272908.4467845676
 I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere215.35795050200477
  —Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does17612.0736004595
 Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds441.13679578113533
 But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of the question221132.97920080528
 And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station903.30051659585
 Simply fag out there for nothing203.76412817430898
 I don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house?  —To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer5764.40869804365
  —I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday20037.725136377398
 Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved8248.906443008884
  —I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly1583.8929831744406
 Why?  —A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one123447.16741535216
 He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you788.7624385035921
 You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did88396793.20121513
  There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that7753721966712.563
 He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals4625.483020613531
 Of course you didn’t notice as much as I did1285.4780842476441
 But it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object2456.9296728129834
  He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple355784457593.62695
  —Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out3737.2139458036095
  The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less4133982.493471285
 Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet921.813303691837
  Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties4786.304554690185

_  Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in745095146.9380935
 A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity6007.314812078606
  —Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description6046811.875119775
  Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly255.19536600164633
 The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor3510.3187006309295
 Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious:  —A beautiful language47225697.455386065
 I mean for singing purposes165.81453438375485
 Why do you not write your poetry in that language? _Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious and full3484.954496855904
 _Belladonna159.88532328120556
 Voglio165.81881419252917
_  Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied:  —To fill the ear of a cow elephant31439.19035105516
 They were haggling over money157.68101373906728
  —Is that so? Mr Bloom asked1219.760727499334
 Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it10354.087833178672
  The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête-à-tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed88604.07589888417
 After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to445008.8455912694
 For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him14950.953680546267
  —Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names9891.929742642677
 Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody216.8203316482626
 Shakespeares were as common as Murphies198.90638971900626
 What’s in a name?  —Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred323500.4259326876
 Of course136.022945360025
 Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across925.7605871375206
  The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking:  —And what might your name be?  Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered:  —Dedalus401755.25855942705
  The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water3424.258529236496
  —You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length1352.3296221699638
  —I’ve heard of him, Stephen said662.733279969416
  Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too7811.0430728768615
  —He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding926.195926013427
 All Irish162.4953815492243
  —All too Irish, Stephen rejoined217.22936366039636
  As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark:  —I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder38393648.027452886
 The lefthand dead shot158.85533684487237
  Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain4684.65545969574
  —Bottles out there, say362.20232299147114

  He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely726.2787607148465
 Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance894.1524369756688
  —Pom! he then shouted once192.49392777377363
  The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg574.2809950974508
  —Pom! he shouted twice181.83899216087863
  Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily:  _—Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,  Never missed nor he never will2731.9250232292006
_  A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley1257.1995280687213
  —Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth1037.6423722421705
  —Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years7584.785522417039
 He toured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus317.2673032949085
 I seen him do that in Stockholm263.24647293966984
  —Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively2001.5003594502905

  —That’s right, the sailor said377.4708424519425

 She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years now, sailing about407.84352462306043
  Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon1779.1473585986712
 Across the world for a wife250.97752672290358
 Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O’Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way1013488.2050198064
 Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee721.4238877960187

  The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:  —You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?  The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand10182888.167781329
  —Thank you, the sailor said830.0750215303119
  He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded:  —We come up this morning eleven o’clock2732.9195557216185

  In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document1036.6632386843332
  —You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter23109.33474790153
  —Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on446.24487246284036
 I was in the Red Sea734.391892278346

 I seen queer things too, ups and downs286.740777498003
 I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid408.0436402920653
  He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously:  —Khaan! Like that11149.71520346834

  He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table22716.057199452855
 The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios334.7254683839967
 Beni, Bolivia169.16941688824372
_  All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier24353.89665015741

  Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark757.5328864865334
 It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile234.10360984878054
_ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice4124.369635149971
 Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q167147.66560540098
t40.78969910601577
 somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest35506891.62001913
 Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through2386.8517280876727
 But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back8667.25182163272
 The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with4872767.778537718
 Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative4769351.853583741
 Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me your valise and I’ll post you the ticket60967.331884733074
 But who? That was the rub938.6727703430839
  Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally111401395.99687782

  It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife3007844570.6492505
 After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life61754.255707757606
 There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d’œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar49897051887192.03
 Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired15055.482277406303
 Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact30102.075363867454
 He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen5826.078758291417
  —I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different41785.72774939934

 Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt3131.8071942120937
  His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to364.8144159672537
  After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket802.7130801982574
  —They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all20043.400346741557
 That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives7720.872893392869
  At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is bliss_ Mr B791.6744975448776
 and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair216467.69404390847
 His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on11655.647782394448
 Funny, very!  There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause210.1784884172589
 One man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the natives _choza de_, another the seaman’s discharge2336.6807129500485
 Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood4731.0787997033185
 He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen1291336.9140693767
  —Ay, boss, the sailor broke in922.5471906508723
 Give us back them papers171.92436275450532
  The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape769.1024576012336
  —Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired3371.519086069178
  The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no21915.879061588694
  —Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn41799840.59721468
  —What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated276.387254099784
 Can you recall the boats?  Our _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering:  —I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships351992.60616774653
 Salt junk all the time305.3610544234098
  Tired seemingly, he ceased192.02318807368403
 On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings396414.85109529627
 And it left him wondering why182.0578225377002
 And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all710.3740747804458
 Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather2.2170538331604932e+16
  —There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month504674.0136772501
 Them are his trousers I’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife2465.8348452990126
 I’m game for that job, shaving and brushup308.7139389364167
 There’s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money1504.8494354834465
  —What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage1878750.074652491
  —Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny? He’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it1885.9703978616346
  The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor12853.736722392243
  —There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts351.7019696453219
 I must get a wash tomorrow or next day286.0354815686107
 It’s them black lads I objects to182.29362027402772
 I hate those buggers299.2805251201631
 Suck your blood dry, they does204.54000502110338
  Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather427478.2168843519
  —Tattoo, the exhibitor explained187.72576472048743
 That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton6285.352157876264
 Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that1322.72507367729
 There he is himself, a Greek416.98784749681306
  —Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor261.03817368535505
  That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the1062.6313150481433
 Someway in his189.28632147094052
 Squeezing or167.15229151132928
  —See here, he said, showing Antonio2973.348663339685
 There he is cursing the mate238.58758925252747
 And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn500511.6777383916
  And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this time stretched over5029.948898024351
  —Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest2187.125075330695
 He’s gone too159.3724241903757
 Ate by sharks after165.12110625973003
 Ay, ay197.72083630245763
  He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before924.1969796009777
  —Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said234.07578805690574
  —And what’s the number for? loafer number two queried325.6433322365358
  —Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor247.6168350460727
  —Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number31747.330849872033
 Ate155.5951902291967
 A Greek he was185.7848719932714
  And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end:       —As bad as old Antonio,      For he left me on my ownio5623.404159612662
  The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill80417.61261398332
 Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink35412513.82921113
 His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B5037140.286951993
) and begged the chance of his washing541.255242121384
 Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing240.70385649064113
 Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt470193.1984441178
 Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off2030.7532474634734
 Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her2625892952.289721
  —The gunboat, the keeper said309.26185015713855
  —It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least770177.3904517331
 Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition1188.1096377453869
 Still no matter what the cause is from401.19140309683075
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
  Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:  —In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade2319.2188838983507
 Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul388.091266613704
 She is a bad merchant305.5174968957566
 She buys dear and sells cheap175.3766854752166
  The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start95447034261.30272
 Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned9188.334384385538
 Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup57925.74869504713
 I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter1466.6332669340277
 Do you?  Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say:  —They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible396559.1369163255
 It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette3133272.2294785557
  Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:  —Simple? I shouldn’t think that is the proper word713269.8700111851
 Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon9306.973176672405
 But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God70429626.07013354
  —O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence498.0744335451699
  On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed2857.253407219508
  —Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief2260.2036732663964
 I’m not so sure about that262.45346233725473
 That’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there9395.46769426001
 My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn’t tell you4009436.4544482916
 Can’t you drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it3592.71284992433
 And take a piece of that bun665.0241143427893
 It’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised305.81682804242115
 Still no-one can give what he hasn’t got214.68850023185288
 Try a bit179.18408525540738
  —Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further4316.56105768035
  Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work2273.2070236809454
 To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders368919.2304541796
 On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying167019.16740352043
 The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of51473.96010494243
 Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where5248.323311143401
 Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved15057.018734942054
  —Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred2183.5954870514684
  —Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual39783.292175903065
 You ought to eat more solid food346.68268772548515
 You would feel a different man300.6600595625283
  —Liquids I can eat, Stephen said361.4775396904588
 But O, oblige me by taking away that knife242.57189522899074
 I can’t look at the point of it1850.374280954369
 It reminds me of Roman history383.6489445067296
  Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it1864.9054671057308
 Do you think they are genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots1055.5240716220314
 Look at him239.84053910565072
  Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel11520219.97640169
  He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him14048.73653447982
 Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity13987.71020007104
 He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described164597.231765993
 On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera5805.871886505019
 And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him601.3842713149062
  —Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed1341.316283704953
 Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with648.0514974701706
 In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods3230941.646258036
 There’s an example again of simple souls205.85194914675935
  However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded3505907577.100764
 On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap1162800608.4471545
  —Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen18029.351650696597
 It comes from the great heat, climate generally240.65790206633486
 My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is1609.9788720201473
 Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, i5144.125631382299

 That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian814.2754474740108
  —The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings3367.341423410345
 _Roberto ruba roba sua_165.47776431751757
  —Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed2927.4124450432614
  —Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino67901.31867280666
  —It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once13868.464016019423
 Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there2660240.5463216794
 The splendid proportions of hips, bosom188.04085220164498
 You simply don’t knock against those kind of women here217.67127951186657
 An exception here and there374.1569143877813
 Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I’m talking about is the female form3260.904938489663
 Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say9836.942466937458
 Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a thing I simply hate to see2560.3416466833824
  Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing224312.40581079188
 Shipahoy of course had his own say to say286.4131756495123
 He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him3694591.7081941175
  So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand22507.367594413437
 That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror26813.863340621192
 Then someone said something about the case of the s1038.8192461235171
 s27.581382532362415
 _Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck1949.2984308693922
 No aid was given177.60436368314697
 Her master, the _Mona_’s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way9278.839380087487
 She had no water, it appears, in her hold543.527119824993
  At this stage an incident happened165.1166399376332
 It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat896.2756178721679
  —Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze15398.69762513262
  He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left392090.6062221553
 While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise442588205.64661795
 The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved23273235.258154932
 Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank3663990.487681401
 A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled202.8268790997453
 Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of37802211.55459126
 And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver10393.966139645521
 He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if, however—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality13310.563221466447
  All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing13388.385303954972
 A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year629.7532963628113
 Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called225.4793034143262
  There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au fait_3031.0374512969274
  What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day’s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line976391.5772613096
  —Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions6676.168470354576
  That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds3558.692726076175
 Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question359949.08886537055
 Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation-_cum_-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:       —The biscuits was as hard as brass      And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse80554.84749519407
      O, Johnny Lever!      Johnny Lever, O!  After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided2579.611382959281
 Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein383270686.10366905
 Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact2021.8042206532505
 You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco10154.636054238643
 Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes126151.89488255272
 There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history1573.8745570439319
 The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed878.8236141970025
 The Boers were the beginning of the end494.3734617504752
 Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot3766.218007053575
 His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland3574.0159548510997
 Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons472.98543917452133
  Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_484.1918317901211
 The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed177.7685802992214
  —Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism3048.769358305065
  To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view1086.4065698295537
  —Who’s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated451.0249363170137
 And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals and generals we’ve got? Tell me that3405.843892866641
  —The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart463.85783243130754
  —That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated603.0230014364894
 The Irish catholic peasant167.79978757842602
 He’s the backbone of our empire172.5347799188419
 You know Jem Mullins?  While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it757.6121258372165
 Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows140569.4414378776
  From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite408878.6115619611
 It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart20451723.900754567
 Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact9089.882015237692
 And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game8933383561.013823
 And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (B4813.35200603828
) couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated219185.21416082137
 Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle342.0763493179481
 Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on5673849206131392.0
 In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome26852.643306307404
 He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high1366.9725952591998
 Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again231.7698086812996
 So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £2503.7718201977837
 s27.581382532362415
 d29.19021952170794
 in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on24626.70235802857
 Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender8015.51171876271
  —He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip1992.8204040520397
 He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively1700.2485564865697
 So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I’m not428169.3044335965
 That was one for him227.30996976538512
 A soft answer turns away wrath168.43650590820857
 He hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw1101.8069840079067
 Am I not right?  He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly67639.6427364052
  —_Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other, _secundum carnem_2766.1595337106673
  —Of course, Mr B619.7535137888407
 proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question2086.3946900774013
 It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves13162.057178214298
 But with a little goodwill all round435.8587694739306
 It’s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality686.7069915264761
 I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form270.5224057590458
 It never reaches anything or stops anything169.65751105239536
 A revolution must come on the due instalments plan223.40420638789362
 It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak303276.09462176816
  —Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market437.64636462382447
  Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was overwhelmingly right7595.377257642243
  —You just took the words out of my mouth, he said1248.9547713684212

  All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop7239404.557673069
  —They accuse, remarked he audibly170.99009817825055
 He turned away from the others, who probably… and spoke nearer to, so as the others… in case they…  —Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of ruining30787.232806598975
 Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say3718.1602244755813
 History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them7566.751159123864
 Why? Because they are imbued with the proper spirit243.39247453352291
 They are practical and are proved to be so400.97923419379583
 I don’t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are3240.8846709036725
 But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty449.03811370575266
 Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America365.745532459605
 Turks155.21273179781858
 It’s in the dogma235.72059712555048
 Because if they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better, at least so I think1709.3666301960284
 That’s the juggle on which the p324.9132757512686
p21.29545135188944
’s raise the wind on false pretences263.9800124216822
 I’m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum238605.06226431846
 That’s the vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man414.0616445178376
 At least that’s my idea for what it’s worth246.36237419198113
 Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work3190.7313343992487
  Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular3612.155685187159
 He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to829046.0132483029
 Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work16760.549270305946
  —Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work291.390404862719
  The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem1261.6461436650372
 observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together497.02972886598894
 Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing634.1731754323672
 Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays507.4160826770487
 That’s work too160.4309756303044
 Important work169.16967871193953
 After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price19126.26374563786
 You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has443.7003637301134
 What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn552.8452364595552
 Each is equally important162.60486767357304
  —You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short113216.56882962107
  —I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated3509.4918319182557
  —But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me685.8251030082115
  —What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension375.71355785031096
 Excuse me148.72061066713053
 Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the latter portion357.9225811889437
 What was it you535.6861634632384
5.2325521685823055
5.2325521685823055
?  Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:  —We can’t change the country9620.42680874855
 Let us change the subject238.17841542528842
  At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry334007.42174344504
 The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part718.7063543083812
 Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state1251.672923454876
 Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people3543.6746450751625
 With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves2360244.1860782686
 For instance there was the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact)3240607.5087161465
 And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains21469189.28375751
 Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it2065171171718929.5
 Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental3261557.0920130615
 Sheer force of natural genius, that223.26177851769273
  For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it130227.89729048165
 Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small278.51862380577325
 Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind3459.6732947964197
 Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz288936.2139966325
 coalminers, divers, scavengers etc175.40719461184167
, were very much under the microscope lately392.8691043505139

  All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years150825.46118986243
 Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered3459.5936364975137
 Something evidently riled them in his death303.32800977408635
 Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands95321.22048896385
 Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility72825.44377595614
 Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren’t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between378242.0379761425

 A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first223405.73039082933
 She put the first nail in his coffin207.86689558421696

  This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_320.6210871702512
 As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings840645.2159753278
 First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into182519.00883123555
 Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of55390714048.915184
 Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s smiles6041101.6162142875

 Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly2317.1825152360575
 A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass’s kick85425443152197.2
 Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream4498.3598310297175
 And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times1955.3498854231939
 Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side1065777.2257084073
 North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds576718.2196668483
  —Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun72738.97269596034
 And, if I don’t greatly mistake she was Spanish too1312.4944778259883
  —The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many43357.06504998747
  —Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before1920.2002208916567
 Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there1272.8335444648078
 So, Spain172.17668904922368
  Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he3800484.6918245596
 Her (the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin’s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution52221.57234257072
  —Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated832.7283230135656

 In or about ninety six295.7171854849379
 Very like her then184.57705421626682
  Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen287754.4878587062
 As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup1695151.2999260505
 She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the20699.80761576238
 He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum129999745.08979098
 Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest9352.71942591049
 Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop455.53333572083926
 Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word421.8251084153361
  The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to462950.20744233177
 But it was scarcely professional etiquette so272.87296030747405
 Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm10023.547666646642
 And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion15176.822466861018
 Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_2222.55630709813
 In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out3150.1414433706723
 Suppose she was gone when he? I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray306769.7470642796
  The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would66597.78672179113
 Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter9480.746421911668
 And why not? An awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business122696.36326887456
 How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate730955.2218867245
 Then the decree _nisi_ and the King’s proctor tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made absolute4477.858812825573
 But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course229543.96181021197
 He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader’s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O’Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals43164320591.30405
 Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive771120.5023868685
 As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character33357.51189170459
 His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave4.7217993639236714e+19
  On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others1357764640298.5215
 He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt1544304805.5868278
  It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime5613.602846821338
 In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs4412477194.9559765
 The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled10945.58348813532

  —Some time yesterday, Stephen said301.7391447651454
  —Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday380.1844026784423
 Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!  —The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself53578.79188825916
  Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected323.98784924626125
 At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas678384.2047502559
 For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word167797814316516.78
  Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night383575.6167330233
 The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak171896302.61137152
 On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives647379.6288340857
 Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered11144.761998390062
 His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway2823.7637225222543
 For one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable12429389.002658892
 At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up4068521.6829348207
 A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_465060978.7505475
 At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew3195.9623493104964
 People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep833.5236891726375

 Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo1224.8190175908912
  —I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over887.7316066224346
 My diggings are quite close in the vicinity584.3219065656749
 You can’t drink that stuff175.92873823439552
 Do you like cocoa? Wait317.3021395313545
 I’ll just pay this lot151.65704207921826
  The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to9410.217029632613
  —Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less16147.046999801161
  All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B’s) busy brain, education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it, and a slice of luck205092235.63199714
 An opening was all was wanted195.40574401581713
 Because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to15494133.005820295
  The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in London somewhere31058.90416174821
 Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement211.66771335943915
 Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to that effect8918.95821641919
 To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why270.8670340710499
  —And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed283.68266391329826
  The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears24963.808045460624
  —Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried576.4788030508106
  —Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading182469.72240105245
 One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking6370.704085457873
 _The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is She367.98185747081993
_  Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark960346.9547941602
  To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark13628075000.699238
  —Come, he counselled to close the _séance_241.34654338275095
  Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_14311.458834862438
 Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door9075.917855136006
  —One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment23340.13149114639
 Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés14544.930299119294
 To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation, saying straight off:  —To sweep the floor in the morning1133.3101680290158
  So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles208469.64022728137
 The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins2686.703455807215
  —It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment33463.561066777256
 The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man325.5312977204568
 Come50.05291484081755
 It’s not far170.9086770174198
 Lean on me172.03322461109335
  Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on accordingly666.6217845236548
  —Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that57194.3886381668
  Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc335.7177477067984
 where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new33921.06170030964
 And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings1047263.4910237553
  So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place37514.32931764787
 Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante’s _Huguenots_, Meyerbeer’s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart’s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat46090358.83753835
 He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_13296.210758841788
 He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini’s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather47163643.78911429
 There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore834083.7064098344
 On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn8783280.162924696
 And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel’s air in _Martha, M’appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat4600583424.246837
 Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B57796.353085735784
 did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull2076661.1656850362
  On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull26986.375263636237
 He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence82871.10185137743
  By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:  —Our lives are in peril tonight16917.09362574052
 Beware of the steamroller235.82638177605943
  They thereupon stopped156.35862329416506
 Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts8564202.340245219
 He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world65183.42904936865
 But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face197916.82215968188
 But it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump11278.061872119126
 Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees2469.2430977946524
 Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye1998.3972244937997
 These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old10860.36618050857
  —What’s this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind172599.95402208302
  He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built38120.837919155194
 Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit:       Von der Sirenen Listigkeit      Tun die Poeten dichten4205.834019976701
  These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_199.0359507594646
 Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did6992.850537960483
  A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B3913872.205500792
 A26.645822769819574
 (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you8917395.494476411
 It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic _conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record—in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have1519439378.0503728
 Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees18580.69043803429
 Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time2375.2258984163495
 But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped2934.8775706556708
 Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_229356.40115994192
 Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows29889424059.655785
 And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone2098490.054473645
 In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all3791202.5274280524
 And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s character, no pun intended639888.731443529
  The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds260670.81833658903
 Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired1364.2245341547555
 And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car411.86074190230823
  Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad2247136.2926990963
       Und alle Schiffe brücken168.47982668564362
  The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_388450.2655994812
 As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_30044992816.79622
     [ 17 ]   What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?  Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place2516582.2594003645
 Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends1085.8134681948293
  Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?  Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen’s collapse18644404.24054432
  Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?  Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial390.0497077200481
 Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence1113.7900352221047
 Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines274.4197044684099
 Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism183.14579579510675
  Were their views on some points divergent?  Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature12619.012881713876
 Bloom assented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († 266 A492165.81847448647
D29.19021952170794
), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree230.11803477397393
 The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman’s hand4728.4896583960835
  Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?  The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees2140.5158514173636
  Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?  In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and Leonard’s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue5236.2871508443595
 In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross1779.6488397220608
 In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines328.51247180929045
 In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown1692.699892483027
 Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom’s) house in Lombard street, west6904.732736977161
  What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?  He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations7042.376761625042
  As in what ways?  From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived10088.94925995269
  What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?  At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey23262.55574698659
  Was it there?  It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding25369.016748146638
  Why was he doubly irritated?  Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget4882.760246514868
  What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?  To enter or not to enter1912.0026929550213
 To knock or not to knock539.651842012734
  Bloom’s decision?  A stratagem176.0606337649081
 Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall2970844.3938124436
  Did he fall?  By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV2439838.9196501593
  Did he rise uninjured by concussion?  Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle65811.72699771824
  What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?  Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle216916.5487097356
  Did the man reappear elsewhere?  After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor676.578435946505
 The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges196.25841849857656
 In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle8363.623986182469
  Did Stephen obey his sign?  Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom’s house203594.66077483978
  What did Bloom do?  He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air6485164.976225446
  Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?  Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics’ theatre of university College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father’s house in Cabra4.24692793941013e+18
  What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?  Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction265924.2921370013
  What did Bloom see on the range?  On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle21950.10647210708
  What did Bloom do at the range?  He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow60910.027586538694
  Did it flow?  Yes206.0960792799393
 From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C152795.89129764982
 E22.00108921275723
, on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound184401100.7348365
  What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?  Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator’s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90 % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon1.617075313391144e+17
  Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?  To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington’s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller500981.06341524556
  What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom’s offer?  That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language137885.56759884994
  What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?  The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius304103.06596663775
  What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?  Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed2191.5517140884585
  Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?  Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation7605.466643914449
  What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?  The phenomenon of ebullition1177.8166744678458
 Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether14832.082105250603
  What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?  A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously1284.5857658047303
  For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?  To shave himself277.4146993454511
  What advantages attended shaving by night?  A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman’s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done3178996.389366392
  Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?  Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand3672.465148907226
  What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?  The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery48220.234009645304
  What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?  On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits256713.20052861486
 On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree’s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co’s white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps’s soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch’s choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one, the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy’s cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom’s and Mrs Fleming’s breakfasts, made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak5131239900.495558
 On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences253.20279925691938
  What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?  Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 8 87, 88 6844.5592949664103
  What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?  Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_, late pink edition, in the cabman’s shelter, at Butt bridge42884182.645633
  Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?  In Bernard Kiernan’s licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street: in David Byrne’s licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O’Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon’s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F8135795.425391063

 (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman’s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction23916934557.672195
  What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?  The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation1351.694452215044
  His mood?  He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied416606.73116609297
  What satisfied him?  To have sustained no positive loss237.64353799158485
 To have brought a positive gain to others213.38142882962507
 Light to the gentiles268.9512792739476
  How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?  He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps’s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed128891.97707591958
  What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?  Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly)6406653.213815351
  Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?  His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps’s massproduct, the creature cocoa6671.969966484443
  Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?  The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side of his guest’s jacket7743.312424057959
 A gift to his guest of one of the four lady’s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition37066.93878656321
  Who drank more quickly?  Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent’s one, six to two, nine to three31236.543971397
  What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?  Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life18294.437607464148
  Had he found their solution?  In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points16917.733304993628
  What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?       An ambition to squint      At my verses in print      Makes me hope that for these you’ll find room3295677.5574221327
      If you so condescend      Then please place at the end      The name of yours truly, L4831.501458296983

  Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?  Name, age, race, creed451.1074842033492

 Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R187573569.16667062

 Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl?  Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist’s non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist’s revelations of white articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from _Everybody’s Book of Jokes_ (1000 pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton372190613338.3199
  What relation existed between their ages?  16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen’s present age Stephen was 6504.0271267576817
 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom’s present age Bloom would be 541264.337160540285
 In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A940188369.7513267
D29.19021952170794
, Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B153025.36201073896
C22.206977252098767
  What events might nullify these calculations?  The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable71066.57645141873
  How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?  Two177.47955735784873
 The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon’s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen’s mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation570419.49123048
 The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin’s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen’s father and Stephen’s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older21997.1657138421
  Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?  Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined2064.005747505143
  Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?  He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low’s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_40296564.92569829
  Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?  Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe135856.9053787767
  What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?  The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers15851.432969335503
  Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?  The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow’s _Physical Strength and How to Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility2959555.1100590825
  Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?  Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles7377.721613301769
  Did either openly allude to their racial difference?  Neither217.92542997835866
  What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom’s thoughts about Stephen’s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen’s thoughts about Bloom’s thoughts about Stephen?  He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not62334341.02875246
  What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?

  Did they find their educational careers similar?  Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame’s school and the high school1804.7580846859998
 Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university9686.40297299255
  Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?  Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him605143.2657536126
  What two temperaments did they individually represent?  The scientific199.49861548205874
  What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?  Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump328642.41471016844
  Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?  Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults1038.2414762142078
 They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls415.2962910284737
  What also stimulated him in his cogitations?  The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A655.5850984890818
 James, the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George’s street, south, the latter at his 6 1/2d shop and world’s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide332833.51024571905

  What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?  The Queen’s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 101873046.629423813

  Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?  Coincidence185.48370376653946
  Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?  He preferred himself to see another’s face and listen to another’s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved2412.8946111422597

  Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?  What to do with our wives54976.40505580729
  What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?  Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable72296.76608167116
  What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?  In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters19169.144256477786
 She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec7938.858020089765
 She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external269.2092749075148
 In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid189.22756430265494
 After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall321.0900397617763
 Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture)16421.57271485087
  What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?  The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction1771.0347092344136
 The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment447.5930634470187
  How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?  Variously436.66834564808755
 By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other’s ignorant lapse3883.751944808644
  With what success had he attempted direct instruction?  She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error16714.088807291137
  What system had proved more effective?  Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest179.64024671899827
  Example?  She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat21504.477050754445
  Accepting the analogy implied in his guest’s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?  Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides)28305.622025577504
  What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?  That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain4247.1215593779625
  Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?  Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist)2528.437535174532
  What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?  By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_ (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care)281742.412034266
  By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m’baad l’zamatejch_ (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate)10270.532811596999
  How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?  By juxtaposition371.5032258189178
 On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 10071536381.33237082
  Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?  Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary906.2735902915107
  What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?  The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S3905034.709222909
 Mary’s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve’s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution10223.201597970245
  What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreducible consummation?       Kolod balejwaw pnimah      Nefesch, jehudi, homijah367.6659935091413
  Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?  In consequence of defective mnemotechnic1806.0233971344169
  How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?  By a periphrastic version of the general text958.6069628560472
  In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?  The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic)2849.8643256007326
  Did the guest comply with his host’s request?  Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters804.0796148486887
  What was Stephen’s auditive sensation?  He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past1250.3593138044641
  What was Bloom’s visual sensation?  He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future497.5796635522099
  What were Stephen’s and Bloom’s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?  Visually, Stephen’s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair464.246745336259

  Condense Stephen’s commentary167.78402975990792
  One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined10039.471596702077
 Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny190.21846205187512
 It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting2734.536768988336
 It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting5733.808186454337
  Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?  He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told10089.381820083985
  Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?  In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy2004.3095406638865
  Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?  He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism5669.918262429311
  From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?  From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds854264.1031887404
 From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping34771.89812201272
  Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?  Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression77282.67973211645
  What other infantile memories had he of her?  15 June 1889529.3461594324741
 A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion214.16838223642512
 A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy208649.47167114212
  What endemic characteristics were present?  Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals2635.563962203324
  What memories had he of her adolescence?  She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess471.32753378095435
 On the duke’s lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated)1085.8648784020215
 On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated)11293.588155649335
 On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated)7751.145418711328
  Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?  Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped3959.053634548769
  What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently?  A temporary departure of his cat541.6472954316898
  Why similarly, why differently?  Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian)2069.1495183422885
 Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation511.26997828565976
  In other respects were their differences similar?  In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness3074.6651899860276
  As?  Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat)1098.2543744711922
 Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat)15658.659369006984
 Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat)5646.9455418680645
 Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat)4123.981350789389
 Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar1974.4179021054244
  In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?  As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression3815086.360990184
  In what manners did she reciprocate?  She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware5782.674789066472
 She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires1337.0310975803961
 She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part8443.721371144004
  What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?  To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess48971.78047626155
  What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?  For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study653.9771372566838
 For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction217.82449586437676
 For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation189.63067794986333
  Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s daughter?  Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter46574.77848994282
  To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?  If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 190317506.08066041441
  What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?  A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag)18441.653223855075
  Was the proposal of asylum accepted?  Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined259.6693409239956
  What exchange of money took place between host and guest?  The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£ 1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former25110.017932693838
  What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?  To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed1416.8431336028186
 To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress443.8186765552307
 To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W364079.98335263046
 and E157.57162439376813
 Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit)31679725.893455174
  What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?  The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler’s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown’s) papa597035.6367642443
 The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J44935.3945995771
 and T104.72410089317493
 Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return2481.1207715717555
  Was the clown Bloom’s son?  No190.52316366332803
  Had Bloom’s coin returned?  Never176.64268875067245
  Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?  Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity830.3612210949117
  He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?  There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay10365675.680898678
  Why did he desist from speculation?  Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed21542.612464271762
  Did Stephen participate in his dejection?  He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void2167.163897148822
  Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?  Not verbally393.69648077923176
 Substantially163.77729387478544
  What comforted his misapprehension?  That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void1025.0426225809674
  In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?  Lighted Candle in Stick borne by BLOOM Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by STEPHEN  With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?  The 113th, _modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de populo barbaro_16174.814234470863
  What did each do at the door of egress?  Bloom set the candlestick on the floor10263.450556555017
 Stephen put the hat on his head417.9583997634606
  For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?  For a cat1578.8828647420967
  What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?  The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit28027.22212913628
  With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?  Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity6875953165.506677
  Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?  Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached76289843.82781765
  Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?  Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e67762.96339558647
g42.48383501805048
, the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers28457563.241153944
  Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?  Of a different order of difficulty79456.4451383519
 Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity1973247.8480693346
  And the problem of possible redemption?  The minor was proved by the major708.7391302338539
  Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?  The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S3029239.5454780124
 Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings1.0818131868372996e+16
  His (Bloom’s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?  That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman241397.92012764636
 That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence4410604.283498271
  Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?  Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet5203.433664045726
  Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?  It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity71337.94716448446
  What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?  Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible1537361.7591643217
  What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s, gaze?  In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street36242.63954177725
  How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?  With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion9932.417592319805
  Both then were silent?  Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces526.3311552749805
  Were they indefinitely inactive?  At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow4202.166636039044
  Similarly?  The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure2221861.425252895
  What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?  To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity11507.771016597642
  To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails1810417.2915835967
  What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?  A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo757.2527581817382
  How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?  By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress19853.476903883977
  How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?  Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles4343911.787962159
  What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?  The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George516285.7173054872
  What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?  By Stephen:       Liliata rutilantium751.5702773635597
 Turma circumdet110.58573012357814
      Iubilantium te virginum99.05302792448174
 Chorus excipiat165.44243269097925
  By Bloom:       Heigho, heigho,      Heigho, heigho486.8957283123642
  Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?  Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave)130474614160903.16
  Alone, what did Bloom hear?  The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane2251.396644083173
  Alone, what did Bloom feel?  The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn1138.3532478934508
  Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?  Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F7309.8758879334955
 Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount)2593.157056404578
  What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?  The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk2345.0982283831563
  Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?  Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east6561242.674930482
  He remembered the initial paraphenomena?  More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon68621.77588961525
  Did he remain?  With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door358.22562857588264
 With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered2925.1395862102827
  What suddenly arrested his ingress?  The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered13608.813972535785
  Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture363.84295965971614
  A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near 786.5067461017995
 the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of whi113161.57923751175
 to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table69000.73508085641
  One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration4013.600231677373
 The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush1117.9092245769016
  What significances attached to these two chairs?  Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence431.04678988943346
  What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?  A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love’s Old Sweet Song_ (words by G78794.06261454105

  With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?  With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the 3807.5939598196483
 upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the 648.7358167699124
 words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration255.84060501313124
  His next proceeding?  From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion296736564.20852035
  What followed this operation?  The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense400.7748041475673
  What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?  A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 49400.450929977347

 on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper6545.622963083532
  What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?  In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl100614.77055169996
 Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle3882.3679915245307
  What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?  The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man9462.996229045862
  Why solitary (ipsorelative)?       Brothers and sisters had he none306.71221399559835
      Yet that man’s father was his grandfather’s son210.41218009435985
  Why mutable (aliorelative)?  From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix374.96919254756307
 From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator204.90227674277585
  What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?  The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite26336.708350474422

  Positing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes become a natural and necessary apodosis?  Given a guarantee equal to the sum sought, the support, by deed of gift and transfer vouchers during donor’s lifetime or by bequest after donor’s painless extinction, of eminent financiers (Blum Pasha, Rothschild, Guggenheim, Hirsch, Montefiore, Morgan, Rockefeller) possessing fortunes in 6 figures, amassed during a successful life, and joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done7052.294352222991
  What eventuality would render him independent of such wealth?  The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore322.8533960848546
  For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?  It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and renovated vitality151625.36709190768
  His justifications?  As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life at least 2/7, viz1506.854196785484
 20 years are passed in sleep210.2154932072027
 As a philosopher he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part of any person’s desires has been realised2084.7126308929255
 As a physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence316.5113258332143
  What did he fear?  The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in the cerebral convolutions3456.2993472826397
  What were habitually his final meditations?  Of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in wonder, a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded, reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life3624.2477197031153

  Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?  Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices934.5102700987925
  As?  The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath3049.8544915427624
  How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?  Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared1788.5168734681235
  What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?  Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves)4617583.263129648
 Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned1332.385515885147
  Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?  In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences131235.20686137758
  What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?  Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat380.1604252557047
 Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate229.05132596463673
 Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper1779.8438872950621
  What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?  The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion274.29593045910366
  What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?  The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip731.8523015864205
  Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity4420.607102268815
  Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector2427.726960630402
 Mendicancy: that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1/4d in the £, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated bailiff’s man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella2587.121826564103
 Destitution: the inmate of Old Man’s House (Royal Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson’s Hospital for reduced but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight1861.7755623329856
 Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper224.24158882088432
  With which attendant indignities?  The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing3627.041542143976
  By what could such a situation be precluded?  By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place)988.156508635245
  Which preferably?  The latter, by the line of least resistance5314.84897567785
  What considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?  Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects178.5895347294056
 The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated256.59170252007107
 The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest193.1074090147465
  What considerations rendered departure not irrational?  The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible26566.38939876551
  What considerations rendered departure desirable?  The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures995.6411963273351
  In Ireland?  The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with submerged petrified city, the Giant’s Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of royal Meath, Brigid’s elm in Kildare, the Queen’s Island shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney23286.8276918383
  Abroad?  Ceylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing Lane, London, E6429.3797170265725

, 5 Dame street, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate of Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique birthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues of nude Grecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled international finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where O’Hara of the Camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters of soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea4193654982196.024
  Under what guidance, following what signs?  At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha delta of Ursa Maior89204.05424223184
 On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day667.1758812640346
  What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?  £ 5 reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street, missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy), height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit235031.08658251315
 Above sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery261.96322221997985
  What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and nonentity?  Assumed by any or known to none421.5466076183171
 Everyman or Noman169.7076566906449
  What tributes his?  Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman461.4993096659758
 A nymph immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman481.51672342372245
  Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?  Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events32925.20962678863
 Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall242.4798299377431
 Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king18860.784707078114
  What would render such return irrational?  An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time723.0161091050712
  What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?  The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire263735.42826929543
  What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied bed?  The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section)331650.6624050522
  What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?  The preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion and premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John): the funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes (Urim and Thummim): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchisedek): the visit to museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along Bedford row, Merchants’ Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the music in the Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a truculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan’s premises (holocaust): a blank period of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and from the cabman’s shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement)1.3534028125273047e+18
  What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?  The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the insentient material of a strainveined timber table34960.18080563304
  What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?  Who was M’Intosh?  What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30 years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?  Where was Moses when the candle went out?  What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, charged with collected articles of recently disvested male wearing apparel, silently, successively, enumerate?  A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement: to obtain a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 5 Dame Street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing Lane, London E82810501.61445455
 C22.206977252098767
): to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in the case of Hellenic female divinities: to obtain admission (gratuitous or paid) to the performance of _Leah_ by Mrs Bandmann Palmer at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street138131.32994496508
  What impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?  The face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin’s Barn40241.03281499845
  What recurrent impressions of the same were possible by hypothesis?  Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning986149.5369117056

  What impersonal objects were perceived?  A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady’s black straw hat1576.871528111967
 Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and floor and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate)52130.42565624382
  Bloom’s acts?  He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed16935837.35343441
  How?  With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death36558.19496819022
  What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?  New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed28346.496410465425
  If he had smiled why would he have smiled?  To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity3523894.593655528
  What preceding series?  Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d’Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society’s Horse Show, Maggot O’Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E4308802653.567419
 (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no last term1081.6051447576742
  What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed?  Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster)7740.6447066947185
  Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?  Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension226385.3295805539
  Envy?  Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse2950.3906204683367
  Jealousy?  Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction414.2471550643828
 Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure447.446392371405
  Abnegation?  In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided19449.856895429166
  Equanimity?  As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity4336.264610926746
 As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun1971.5484668186803
 As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king’s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder6412.21078979495
 As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease676.6883011288106
 As more than inevitable, irreparable183.2026838157141
  Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?  From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated7041.095501489099
  What retribution, if any?  Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right395.5460048583231
 Duel by combat, no190.70541520292787
 Divorce, not now202.40565717132625
 Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly335.5029014253506
 Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly188.84583896324256
 If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both4990.510638901344
  By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?  The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars442283423.3671461
  In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?  Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality5017716.456282016
  The visible signs of antesatisfaction?  An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation: a silent contemplation1446.4390260430657
  Then?  He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation1707.1451826958692
  The visible signs of postsatisfaction?  A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection1461.5481465632174
  What followed this silent action?  Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation208.33136317715093
  With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?  Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown739369.1427484769
 Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandmann Palmer of _Leah_ at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn’s (Murphy’s) Hotel, 35, 36 and 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entituled _Sweets of Sin_, anonymous author a gentleman of fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility105392174627.43663
  Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?  Absolutely177.58985843698215
  Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?  Stephen Dedalus, professor and author1465.1461696819165
  What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?  By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8 September 1870), viz16291.404410664321
 8 October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place 5 weeks previous, viz96794.65438960177
 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ19799.56884150733
 By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed5245861.374922187
  What moved visibly above the listener’s and the narrator’s invisible thoughts?  The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow984.4216701521548
  In what directions did listener and narrator lie?  Listener, S270.1687581852956

  Where?  •     [ 18 ]   Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her6819675495.008004
  soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging92121466688.08159
  to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but 279457.34480290866
 I suppose Id have to dring it364.6275528480633
  into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have 3802.110619888753
 him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack 309418.87833484117
 bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when 25166153.24683067
 he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing 6514.2426254958655
 I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere 3238.755610885852
Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes 1526635.6416239336
 I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on128284.59990353891
  him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if105756173.95056534
 they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has8002798.582159126
 a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite224445103607.1311
  him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough 8030164.138999839
 for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was1748514.8526683652
  but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was 3794576902.97674
 out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up 25640944.466723748
 to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a 23376475859375.703
 change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so2456207280660.821
  on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself 6644641179.281934
 anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes 823499.8171213632
 love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right 5714674744.946116
 out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of 7471484841.069016
 course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly 22390184.988649074
 in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip 76253745.69773391
 those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful 137235445.4509633
 thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times1560952906.1430929
  with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like 187017.51148148513
 iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that57679060765.30842
  determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the 467004279.9425451
 pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy6667218481.001577
  not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly 479498.85895889206
 I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman20154549689.160847
  is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of 83394584648048.67
 to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though 41493655.15344618
 I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something 57260143.134788126

on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord

could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know

  pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have85064004.73762237
  a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it231986126565.45486
  and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching24262666.445454784
  about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that63285731.943927184
 I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if 183836235.88856924
 I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but 566722011.9053077
 I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him770633.046786408
  being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were146460.4638148496
  yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up23717675.072220903
  to make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her75368066009282.77
  and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come3.624676824644724e+25
  again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday781136208102.0686

  Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20 years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman

practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like

Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that
