 He held the bowl aloft and intoned:

—_Introibo ad altare Dei_	1.5381404491417184e+17


—Back to barracks! he said sternly	3725688760.003721
 Shut your eyes, gents	2668991.532746637


He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and
there with gold points	5.945547162580918e+32
 Chrysostomos	193.68270965874825


—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly	32122820230.046352
 That will do nicely	165875.59828280227
 The plump shadowed face and
sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages	3.4081200243950653e+21
 Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!

He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
laughing to himself	6.707347193036181e+26


Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on	14720707.72226641
 He thinks
you’re not a gentleman	20846003.55250513
 Because he comes from Oxford	1624444.1706525018
 You know, Dedalus, you
have the real Oxford manner	3960318252330.75
 He can’t make you out	2042668.3003575627


He shaved warily over his chin	23806285.347536616
 Where is
his guncase?

—A woful lunatic! Mulligan said	71384081706383.1
 If
he stays on here I am off	2373628830.5426774
 He hopped down
from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily	5227093633444055.0


—Scutter! he cried thickly	41289913.9076638

You can almost taste it, can’t you?

He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair
oakpale hair stirring slightly	1.5010468071311362e+30


—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said	2061990229.7439613


He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s
face	275155085868740.28


—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said	3700498100956.797
	13.951045332398436
 Kinch, the loveliest
mummer of them all!

He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously	2.500904543526133e+22


Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve	2.941885761647365e+29

Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart	8100173187752092.0
 How are the secondhand breeks?

—They fit well enough, Stephen answered	7408211071508895.0


Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip	3756162333.63829
 God
knows what poxy bowsy left them off	3334726344.7969556
 You’ll look spiffing in them	2401714.445641973
 I can’t wear them if they are grey	1843832894.1374114


—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror	4817205187105393.0

Etiquette is etiquette	30998.618986528396
 He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey
trousers	294192221722.5473


He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
smooth skin	5.2357821500287224e+16


—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,
says you have g	1.1767988174766716e+22
 He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman	550891944.7154163

General paralysis of the insane!

He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings
abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea	3.3860079021542736e+30
 Hair on end	15708.212006476015
 As he and others see me	23926740.057661142
 Who chose this
face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin	236157391853241.9
 The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi	2121778594.1633184


Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes	28258981371272.51
 If
Wilde were only alive to see you!

Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:

—It is a symbol of Irish art	1.4671648447658482e+29
 The cracked lookingglass of a servant	20877859.02217091


Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him
round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he
had thrust them	9.867354393378183e+30


—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly	8.266112587111481e+19

God knows you have more spirit than any of them	220280580283.0588
 He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his	684519310576277.4

Hellenise it	2252.744551178386
 His arm	1594.2546590991783


—And to think of your having to beg from these swine	49858816187239.35
 I’m the only one
that knows what you are	32770827766.60287
 O, I shall
expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit
ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the
table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the
tailor’s shears	8.811155109576237e+54
 A deaf
gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower

 omphalos	124.55403143323326
 There’s nothing wrong with him except at
night	1685669202.6345675


—Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently	296930985587.6376
 Cough it up	15702.81887230922
 I’m
quite frank with you	1642657.9306230443


—Do you wish me to tell you? he asked	4095533082639.182
 I don’t remember anything	159395.21107246345


He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke	2330500431.318542
 A light wind passed his brow,
fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of
anxiety in his eyes	1.3014414527448486e+24


Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:

—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s
death?

Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:

—What? Where? I can’t remember anything	6.558597377731191e+45
 I remember only ideas and
sensations	25035929.61181251


—Yes? Buck Mulligan said	23594303.858634666


—You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is
beastly dead	7.041216492105069e+19
 Well? What harm is that?

He shook his constraint from him nervously	4902095727184229.0
 It’s a beastly
thing and nothing else	181738496.53917298
 It simply doesn’t matter	142378.16377704596
 Why?
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected
the wrong way	6.8430886127982486e+19
 She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks
buttercups off the quilt	758196158358074.0
 Humour her till it’s over	1550792.2036371643
 Absurd! I suppose I did say it	2326076485.196362
 I
didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother	281953200975.4149


He had spoken himself into boldness	23562083.543225493


Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel	175798490.26655018


He walked off quickly round the parapet	203584119.9337884
 Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he
felt the fever of his cheeks	1.5322864902652538e+21
 What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola,
Kinch, and come on down	1.4256130433735232e+18


His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level
with the roof:

—Don’t mope over it all day, he said	3.7138993821861688e+31
 I’m inconsequent	1988.767089820975
 Give up the
moody brooding	3896388.2648472255


His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
the stairhead:

     And no more turn aside and brood
     Upon love’s bitter mystery
     For Fergus rules the brazen cars	1.84411208932668e+35
 Wavewhite wedded words
shimmering on the dim tide	4892633297.0041685


A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in
deeper green	9.777980417382304e+18
 Fergus’
song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords	7.909646071134483e+19

Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music	2826676612586.083
 She was crying in her wretched bed	285144803.57190186



Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys	424381559590.2617
 Her shapely
fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s
shirts	1.6116460306529218e+16


In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its
loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,
bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes	7.84956064681211e+47


Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul	6.3997091548660936e+16
 The ghostcandle to light her agony	30628422.69693501
 Her eyes on me to strike me down	2582442882.6410723
_

Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!

No, mother! Let me be and let me live	1.7572817299808095e+20
 It came nearer up the
staircase, calling again	25864735886.35576
 Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry,
heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words	7.340679684326851e+22


—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said	3785888350752.2256


His head disappeared and reappeared	3931372.011570989
 The nickel shavingbowl shone,
forgotten, on the parapet	711841173912.1678
 Why should I bring it down? Or leave it
there all day, forgotten friendship?

He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck	2.7480857471166826e+50

So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes	219213523862.55695
 I am another now
and yet the same	2833914077.0330267
 Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning	6.547838781815977e+36


—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said	2471921352.83564


—Have you the key? a voice asked	37726236741.2089
	13.951045332398436
 But, hush! Not a
word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey	7.356388965010561e+23
 The grub is ready	279358.5341460086
 Where’s the sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk	5058769302490.059
 I told her to come after eight	222711544.92767492
 There’s a lemon in the
locker	23262346.50151521


—O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said	581166065152606.2
 Pour out the tea there	1957136.0870000084
 Here,
I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs	381100686017.67633


He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three
plates, saying:

—_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti	1.06134874773724e+31


—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said	298578382039.9274
 But, I say, Mulligan, you do
make strong tea, don’t you?

Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old
woman’s wheedling voice:

—When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said	1.4844750744459918e+51
_

He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
on his knife	1.509713137812178e+20
 Five lines
of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of
Dundrum	8.826541993457995e+18


—Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone	43805741435326.22
 Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann	70075891597407.01


—Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth
and blinking his eyes pleasantly	1.2228989035680216e+22
	13.951045332398436
_

He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned	9657934575825.965
 Kinch, get the jug	2165953.2261291947


—To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her	370972789125.5364


—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of
the collector of prepuces	3.3102860335459287e+19


—A quart, Stephen said	29673529.30326376


He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
milk, not hers	5.2765073751663935e+19
 She poured again a measureful and a
tilly	5436038384.314541
 She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out	6400552765319.45

Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on
her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs	6.129967774330656e+28


—Taste it, sir, she said	4038674011.555646


—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered	32401793707.81486
 She bows her old head to a voice
that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
slights	2.732278070122767e+25
 To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there
is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in
God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey	9.710209212633528e+36


—Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines	7.633684662676188e+17


—Irish, Buck Mulligan said	25703391.30666266
 Is there Gaelic on you?

—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it	1.818019912846201e+23
 I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows	220745077074.91684
 Wonderful entirely	1841.6350646872556
 Would you like a cup, ma’am?

—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
milkcan on her forearm and about to go	9.785942768636202e+36


Haines said to her:

—Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?

Stephen filled again the three cups	1.275896848348697e+30
 Time enough	1416.0744046828308
 Good
morning, sir	195231.08888969125


She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:

_—Heart of my heart, were it more,

More would be laid at your feet	3.165420593945427e+33
 Hurry out to your school kip and bring
us back some money	20916844163430.25
 Ireland
expects that every man this day will do his duty	3160116818547.8257


—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your
national library today	6.59700593502218e+20


He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:

—Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?

Then he said to Haines:

—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month	1.1132310212585439e+41


—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey
trickle over a slice of the loaf	1.7545377346446654e+24


Speaking to me	16962.228342332986
 They wash and tub and scrub	26949268.939960074
 Agenbite of inwit	14175.18434522785

Conscience	127.46044471815193
 Yet here’s a spot	150051.9542339455


—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
of Irish art is deuced good	7.964623272709887e+20
 I was just
thinking of it when that poor old creature came in	377404812030083.9


—Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked	3303272194704.7085


Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of
the hammock, said:

—I don’t know, I’m sure	4.721144868154235e+29


He strolled out to the doorway	24521508.147041824
 Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen
and said with coarse vigour:

—You put your hoof in it now	8.008122522948612e+21
 What did you say that for?

—Well? Stephen said	47026104698249.65
 It’s a toss up, I think	398137241.83504194


—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes	2.95683942269338e+28


—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him	6769894805678905.0


—From me, Kinch, he said	4291249176.695228
 Damn all else they
are good for	185616224.68313453
 Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all	3957084051965722.5


—There’s your snotrag, he said	418054135.37288845
 His hands plunged and
rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief	7.246406786695714e+16
 God,
we’ll simply have to dress the character	26497342659.44033
 Contradiction	193.68270965874825
 Mercurial Malachi	1849.8371770018439
 A limp black missile flew out of
his talking hands	316979061021.19934


He walked on	18914.373854273166
 Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy
bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses	1.3450423022072277e+20


—Down, sir! How dare you, sir!

Haines asked:

—Do you pay rent for this tower?

—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said	1.4249054110052966e+32


—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder	6847911561913867.0


They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:

—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say	1.8736178309139335e+23
 I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas
and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up	1.2718287061670915e+20


He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
primrose waistcoat:

—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?

—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer	9.407912748971891e+50
 Is it some paradox?

—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said	6575282011054.821

It’s quite simple	12785.729636457143


Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands	293721549855.1627


Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent	1.1996992365710446e+18

The Father and the Son idea	30194176.760247342
 The Son striving to be atoned with the
Father	71053638045.66547
 He moved
a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and
began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:

_—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard	3.725167211559785e+42

My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird	25756176726.007877

What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
And Olivet’s breezy	644554878810788.6
 Goodbye, now, goodbye!_

He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his
winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh
wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries	2.4762996888665045e+44
 I’m not a
believer myself, that is to say	553799538055.9828


—You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked	5715982344247.246


—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette	418092384920.13495
 He put it back in his
sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang
it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk
towards Stephen in the shell of his hands	2.0046270294417143e+43
 You don’t stand for that, I suppose?

—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
example of free thought	3.1888532733266586e+29


He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his
side	5.7347380680936525e+17
 Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels	35913196972882.48
 I paid the rent	182442.11679744738
 Now I eat his salt
bread	17337178.92142137
 That was in his
eyes	2682001.0332688596


—After all, Haines began	24874032.905186076


Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was
not all unkind	5.738051096627985e+17


—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an
Italian	6.262468873669484e+18


A crazy queen, old and jealous	346428365.8937693
 What do you mean?

—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and
the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church	1.3823975426642154e+28


Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he
spoke	62211528080867.15
 An Irishman must think
like that, I daresay	24105624520.74275
 Symbol of the apostles in the mass
for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in
affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church
militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs	4.760943977993005e+40
 A horde of heresies
fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom
Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the
consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning
Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who
held that the Father was Himself His own Son	9.452434924877516e+67
 The void
awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a
worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who
defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their
shields	1.32661181174427e+49


Hear, hear! Prolonged applause	25600811.47725138
 _Zut! Nom de Dieu!_

—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one	5.115155970450161e+26
 I
don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either	2.919609440148632e+16

That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now	345692367243.674


—She’s making for Bullock harbour	21937376.73482466


The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain	46712220323131.48


—There’s five fathoms out there, he said	45209360802.62494


The man that was drowned	2328127.9723932864
 A sail veering about the blank bay waiting
for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,
saltwhite	1.6597333979953104e+28
 An elderly man shot up near
the spur of rock a blowing red face	2399317402939198.5
 He scrambled up by the stones,
water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water
rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
sagging loincloth	4.164071218239893e+39


Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and
lips and breastbone	1.248072896144775e+31


—Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said	360010494833.4232


—Going over next week to stew	182042302.68645865


—Spooning with him last night on the pier	42795678813.01286


—Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said	20716681879.947216


He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
tritely:

—Redheaded women buck like goats	1.7956477689989589e+25
_ Toothless
Kinch and I, the supermen	4970982410.782131


He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
clothes lay	6.62295177480114e+17


—Are you going in here, Malachi?

—Yes	4625755096491.122
 Make room in the bed	2085827.5626894613


The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the
middle of the creek in two long clean strokes	7.939823436365558e+22
 Haines sat down on a
stone, smoking	2393116717.6127076


—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat	8.069592667350469e+18
 Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
clothes	1635731701.2990928


—And twopence, he said, for a pint	570744999270.6797
 Throw it there	16378.529085468477


His plump body plunged	207990.6127582364


—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the
path and smiling at wild Irish	6.869969660630289e+22

     Turma circumdet	2686.4209888162945
 Home also I cannot go	1510288.6856963506


A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea	906919618860887.4
 Turning
the curve he waved his hand	212279984.89626822
 A sleek brown head, a
seal’s, far out on the water, round	1.5490612199819427e+17


—Very good	17543.20146662645
 Where?

The boy’s blank face asked the blank window	231338445832.25662
 A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings
of excess	9949481626840178.0
 I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling
masonry, and time one livid final flame	1.4160379282958703e+22
 C	138.9578885370511
 And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done
for	8414639793209906.0


—Wait	1661.8215669417978
 You, Armstrong	19257.52855378425
 Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?

A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel	7.863557089018098e+17
 Welloff people,
proud that their eldest son was in the navy	67685541742365.97
 Vico Road, Dalkey	225660.04298095932


—Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier	31862155279.95108
 Armstrong looked round
at his classmates, silly glee in profile	4267372474966.532
 A thing out in the water	29661924.25342508
 They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent	163079729163.7598
 With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily	7317553636127188.0


—How, sir? Comyn asked	251394418.30650306
 Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly
for the smooth caress	3947497534932395.5
 Go on, Talbot	199975.56459809883
 He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:

_—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more
For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor	2.089003711137736e+45
 By his
elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy	6855637245458.714
 Tranquil brightness	1785.3206038556825
 The soul is in a manner
all that is: the soul is the form of forms	1.100157594028744e+19


Talbot repeated:

_—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,

Through the dear might	9.663930775417521e+21
 He leaned back and went on again, having
just remembered	2918027952602.3613
 To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s	7820863745182.216


—Yes, sir	239799.14518262498
 Hockey at ten, sir	2786408.923643119
 Thursday	127.14962840479002

Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all
gabbling gaily:

—A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir	4.719644499238052e+25


—This is the riddle, Stephen said:

     The cock crew,
     The sky was blue:
     The bells in heaven
     Were striking eleven	1.3910424236402302e+27

     ’Tis time for this poor soul
     To go to heaven	2362622237804.9097
 We didn’t hear	14591.089486212677


Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated	16957963853.135954


Stephen, his throat itching, answered:

—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush	1.123608850682888e+19


Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
copybook	353243891216456.4
 His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness
and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading	7.008711278023248e+21
 On his
cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent
and damp as a snail’s bed	2.6599101065447405e+26


He held out his copybook	2807823.0938600358
 Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in
her heart	4.4370363025147176e+16
 But for her the race of the world would have trampled him
underfoot, a squashed boneless snail	4.134898333735301e+20
 She had loved his weak watery
blood drained from her own	4020578213022.995
 Was that then real? The only true thing in
life? His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal
bestrode	1.4159944143246701e+25
 She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in
the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes	1.5947562158908879e+25
 She had saved him from
being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been	8.643669525038186e+16


Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem	49580971873.046394
 He proves by
algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather	318919507885.6882
 Sargent
peered askance through his slanted glasses	166786921.11609972
 Hockeysticks rattled in the
lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field	1.2267305858263628e+19


Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of
their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes	4.980771813548793e+26
 Give hands,
traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors	1.734080829244853e+19


—Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?

—Yes, sir	7.534208175470225e+19
 _Amor matris:_ subjective
and objective genitive	97880186491.45676
 With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had
fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands	1.0083125991615463e+22
 Secrets, silent, stony
sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their
tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned	3.0699654543835667e+29


The sum was done	182875.72421069327
 Thanks, Sargent answered	163091.8853441796


He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his bench	9.08635689976265e+19


—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said
as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form	1.9600077806159148e+28


He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
field where sharp voices were in strife	1.281313862858335e+22
 They were sorted in teams and
Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet	1.1770324601437995e+20
 He turned his angry white moustache	16666132.307765244


And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice
cried sternly:

—What is the matter? What is it now?

Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms
closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his
illdyed head	2.1161181056371124e+57
 On the sideboard the tray of Stuart
coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be	1.2949164391229416e+21
 And snug in their
spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached
to all the gentiles: world without end	2.9612052408833972e+26


He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong	433978804449521.25
 It
slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and
laid them carefully on the table	1.3706921634102113e+25


—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away	97973410298354.64


And now his strongroom for the gold	435674709.311259
 An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead
treasure, hollow shells	262647489817.7816


—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand	8.723543860131314e+16

These are handy things to have	16948294.41398972
 This is for sovereigns	173938.65270254092
 And here crowns	16248.466004402622
 See	146.02148281804753


—Three twelve, he said	27572301.48969173


—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy
haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers	1.6570006769933159e+28


—No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said	32995309161.62864
 You’ll pull it out somewhere
and lose it	2014581013.4578817
 You just buy one of these machines	192478728.23685724
 You’ll find them very
handy	1302157.4703877738


—Mine would be often empty, Stephen said	25878939289.70876


The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same	7530897818797214.0
 Money is power	15965.731728253764
 I know, I know	2688905.8313965304

—Iago, Stephen murmured	24314620.27701103


He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare	318740602098281.7


—He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said	369928033326.86005
 A poet, yes, but
an Englishman too	33596282268.263744
 Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you
know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s
mouth?

The seas’ ruler	3.3714614191840104e+34
 His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems
history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating	2.0553502014824255e+26
 That’s not English	14332.420487362286
 A French Celt said that	2995175.8486077217


—I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast	9.110571041231414e+16


_—I paid my way	24498737.416193325
 I never borrowed a shilling in my life	3563583854.5987616

Curran, ten guineas	230618.52302848967
 Fred Ryan, two shillings	3634190.9566140734


Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox	3035366873438.266


—I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously	51461262905.68206


—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said	1.5045470203478502e+18
 Hoarse, masked and armed, the
planters’ covenant	910933996782.899
 Croppies lie

 We are

—Alas, Stephen said	2401216.008121296
 He voted for
it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to
do so	3.11079510989943e+23

 He saw their
speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished
crowds	1.195854745635522e+19

Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle	43662476846619.71
 I am among them, among their battling bodies in a
medley, the joust of life	1.8278731389904988e+19


He came to the table, pinning together his sheets	489394705757.72626

—Dying, he said again, if not dead by now	47996760774825.97


—A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or
gentile, is he not?

—They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely	1.0929350285865172e+38

—What? Mr Deasy asked	58068958039007.266


Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked
between his fingers	5.237769175327983e+18

hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield	3.0129467865588163e+30

still	1.7533626027913968e+17
 By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day	566204443729975.6

And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist	17084389.647446964
 Feel	139.81510891478086
 That one is going too	2209116.4545229515
 Toothless Kinch,
the superman	2878091.4542792165
 Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?

My handkerchief	5.412050371508032e+17
 Did I not take it up?

His hand groped vainly in his pockets	5351143002318054.0


He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,
carefully	1.240344202520583e+18
 Perhaps there is someone	167756.78665448344

[ 4 ]

Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls	8.720810485051004e+20


The coals were reddening	374106.0935547308


Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right	31197307275384.453
 She didn’t like
her plate full	16606782.188017061
 Good	143.93233424207187


—Mkgnao!

—O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire	1.7364484886288413e+20


The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the
table, mewing	6.692390330060028e+18
 Prr	193.68270965874825
 Scratch
my head	21425.075733131423
 Clean to see:
the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her
tail, the green flashing eyes	3.805228765182406e+27

Cruel	129.00148738880966
 Curious mice never squeal	255888.45077522047


—Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly	10611042783727.951
 Afraid of the
chookchooks	289313.1729155281
 I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens	522252771562.92645
 He watched the dark eyeslits
narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones	4663253979125168.0
 Or
kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps	51735576381.102295
 Ham and eggs, no	2003876.2474801675
 No good eggs with
this drouth	15826264.25439276
 Want pure fresh water	125930.8830353828
 Thursday: not a good day either for
a mutton kidney at Buckley’s	355170378709514.75
 Fried with butter, a shake of pepper	2292063294.016909
 While the kettle is boiling	1737258.496793767
 She
lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean	42923940659.009125
 Why are their tongues so
rough? To lap better, all porous holes	7599332726377827.0


On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by
the bedroom door	7.90598839986241e+19
 She might like something tasty	2390300.7499814597
 Be back in a minute	2115919.05313769


And when he had heard his voice say it he added:

—You don’t want anything for breakfast?

A sleepy soft grunt answered:

—Mn	2.1163555638175612e+30
 Pity	134.75175575246843
 All the way from Gibraltar	2040315.014669788

Forgotten any little Spanish she knew	13900853.629285803
 Wonder what her father gave for
it	226815923.47067925
 Old style	1353.0938768086319
 Ah yes! of course	1991505.0552598583
 At
Plevna that was	273591.6991530778


His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat
and his lost property office secondhand waterproof	6.424727288616481e+21
 Quite safe	1278.8985741739239


On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey	55885492634276.29
 Potato I have	16237.07174032352
 Creaky
wardrobe	2686.4209888162945
 But I couldn’t go in
that light suit	2320787676.277538
 Make a picnic of it	2269705.543623049
 Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at
dawn	37335013330294.34

Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically	4605753973948.986
 Turbaned faces going by	202941.59300896214
 Dark caves of
carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking
a coiled pipe	2.062000539879088e+22
 Might meet a robber or two	17294584.319478065
 A shiver of the trees,
signal, the evening wind	4697882813463.666
 I pass on	18353.61476420236
 High wall: beyond strings twanged	18709317.27400648
 Night sky, moon, violet,
colour of Molly’s new garters	25538047282238.25
 Strings	127.83755836664014
 A girl playing one of
those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers	4402433491318782.0


Probably not a bit like it really	214885897.6356661
 Ikey touch
that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest	2173934681276.4065
 g	130.06127850942767


Baldhead over the blind	269614.43177605444
 No use canvassing him for an
ad	167543253.40749162
 Still he knows his own business best	188036319.86397895
 There he is, sure enough, my
bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching
the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket	3.705913155685613e+30
 Simon Dedalus takes him
off to a tee with his eyes screwed up	435267921777508.3


—Lovely weather, sir	2074426.305727423


Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the
county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar	3.242715493145319e+26
 Then, lo and
behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons	8.158083632634123e+16
 Then think
of the competition	3279216.8214881937
 Good puzzle would be cross Dublin
without passing a pub	150532131869.7186
 Put
down three and carry five	16572474.393670555
 On the wholesale orders perhaps	2710638.3621679475
 Say he got ten per cent off	154829622.8872593
 O more	1505.970872362669
 Fifteen	132.69116580087143
 Boys are they? Yes	1899707.4723736185
 Inishark	193.68270965874825


He halted before Dlugacz’s window, staring at the hanks of sausages,
polonies, black and white	1.7680731190557917e+20
 Fifteen multiplied by	19915.72028507076
 Would she buy it too,
calling the items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda	1.9196458882881534e+21
 And a
pound and a half of Denny’s sausages	45229321872.95776
 New
blood	1383.2001740102016
 The way her crooked
skirt swings at each whack	24634953212.354454
 Moses Montefiore	1845.293536254699
 I thought he was	214670.10083478317
 Farmhouse, wall round
it, blurred cattle cropping	28419241856.009533
 The crooked skirt
swinging, whack by whack by whack	164244590107.84988


—Now, my miss, he said	4265728684.5761404


She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out	568381000589386.0


—Thank you, my miss	25695935.265376344
 To catch up and walk behind her if she went
slowly, behind her moving hams	5.372902695267118e+17
 She stood
outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right	771236788902294.5
 Crusted
toenails too	18286.859021554446
 Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways	56625264298.39393
 The
sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast	6893123728738.178
 They like
them sizeable	239543.33085939492
 Prime sausage	1742.619211779755


His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket	382549363023483.75

Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them
on the rubber prickles	7.592648629266534e+19
 They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,
disc by disc, into the till	4.916701467284262e+18
 Another time	1456.9689922727325
 No: better not: another time	233986017.64018166


—Good morning, sir	2313468.6632453
 What matter?

He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely	22595063427258.793
 Olives cheaper: oranges need
artificial irrigation	504012793.68477076
 Your
name entered for life as owner in the book of the union	586313024536208.5
 Can pay ten
down and the balance in yearly instalments	489134742645.6406


Nothing doing	1366.8093131713315
 Still an idea behind it	1749873.7139852326


He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat	279715372347.64667
 Olives are packed in
jars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews	1.0465830782937866e+17

Knows the taste of them now	23128174.769912235
 Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates	728182732.3549879

Citrons too	2047.4028037763096
 Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin’s parade	14663878582.503223
 And
Mastiansky with the old cither	34516799.65146391
 Pleasant evenings we had then	2214010.5686617955
 They fetched high
prices too, Moisel told me	61863289575.0152
 Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant
old times	35333117830.12258
 Coming all that way: Spain,
Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant	987579863635273.5
 How do
you? Doesn’t see	20176756.88374745
 Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore	265226403957.99902
 His back
is like that Norwegian captain’s	464759158.0670124
 Wonder if I’ll meet him today	15081103.963244958

Watering cart	1783.0333768125784
 On earth as it is in heaven	258877231.53350136
 Grey	135.98296643831588


No, not like that	2701750.7421064265
 A barren land, bare waste	26324159.11206482
 Vulcanic lake, the dead
sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth	1.7799601397204955e+19
 No wind could lift
those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters	361971187867415.6
 All
dead names	13854.39363878084
 Old now	1547.9492484820153
 A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s,
clutching a naggin bottle by the neck	3911367373737473.5

Dead: an old woman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world	808992710342909.9


Grey horror seared his flesh	1921376.2900474584
 Cold oils slid along his
veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak	1.2029610217775915e+20
 Morning mouth bad images	126802.54388641863
 On the
hands down	227746.07902832545
 Number eighty still unlet	267981.9855808024
 Towers, Battersby, North,
MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills	748377783471062.5
 Plasters on a sore
eye	2571870.454951931


Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim
sandals, along the brightening footpath	9.534182516222963e+20
 Runs, she runs to meet me, a
girl with gold hair on the wind	6.149583731241659e+17


Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor	43163535771.03547
 Mrs Marion Bloom	14872.620705641337
 Bold hand	1342.4154303585622

Mrs Marion	1355.281944226172


—Who are the letters for?

He looked at them	4217504510701.4263
 And
a letter for you	2735683.1821805174


—That do? he asked, turning	3522891698.3546286


She was reading the card, propped on her elbow	303579132577.2881


—Hurry up with that tea, she said	35263491669.830956


As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:

—Poldy!

—What?

—Scald the teapot	1.0401305836075681e+22
 Having set it to draw he took
off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the
lump of butter slide and melt	1.7009205193825483e+30
 Kosher	124.25343492184844
 He let the bloodsmeared paper fall
to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce	8.359188783713434e+18
 Pepper	125.87954127276697


The tea was drawn	193886.07302872193
 Only five she was then	1873451.4031727074
 No, wait:
four	2283746.6353520188
 Putting pieces of
folded brown paper in the letterbox for her	3668250496159.0454

     I’d rather have you without a farthing
     Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden	1.904213470586157e+16


Poor old professor Goodwin	135218.47175596107
 The night Milly brought it into the
parlour	2637150806.856881
 He carried it
upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle	40728162163570.836
 He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large
soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder	1.0268478839799198e+24


Bold hand	1342.4154303585622
 Marion	133.7001489380697
 He’s bringing the programme	153402.34523180977
 C	138.9578885370511
 Rather stale smell that incense leaves
next day	1148480870.1265662
 Like foul flowerwater	18874.064157204597


—Would you like the window open a little?

She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:

—What time is the funeral?

—Eleven, I think, he answered	8.226930917954955e+39
 I didn’t see the paper	2179921.1043937774
 Her petticoat	1422.4651403979815


He felt here and there	2185411.5006002304
 _Voglio e non vorrei_	14842663.276777409
 Not in the bed	235677.8514513949
 The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of
the orangekeyed chamberpot	2353220931930310.0
 There’s a word I wanted to
ask you	2637794207.950583
 That
means the transmigration of souls	20374890.469335057


He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes	31276761230.629147
 Dolphin’s Barn	1174.8738051083192
 He turned over the
smudged pages	30426763.492636815
 _Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_	39939250749.09632
 Illustration	193.68270965874825

Fierce Italian with carriagewhip	181092.82033702484
 _The monster Maffei desisted and flung
his victim from him with an oath_	7.44557682225907e+16
 Cruelty behind it all	160626.11429515315
 Mob gaping	1165.2650862565285

Break your neck and we’ll break our sides	1341341865.0850418
 Our souls	1361.3431204017784


—Yes, she said	2903583.342658371
 There’s nothing smutty in it	2675508.135454812


She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways	20548921383230.945


Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they’ll write to
Kearney, my guarantor	9.830009880143867e+17
 That we
all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other
planet	4.524450807726126e+17
 Some say they remember their
past lives	166225790.59868252
 An example would be better	1572184.4959346666
 Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer	49878270323.143585
 Three and six
I gave for the frame	2696502750.7196975
 Naked
nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then	7506489257194330.0


He turned the pages back	2137353.572293483


—Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it	584303817517725.8
 What they called nymphs, for example	319054376.7131928


Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar	2847029353.128557
 She gazed straight before her,
inhaling through her arched nostrils	2787650825435.3027
 Did you leave anything on the fire?

—The kidney! he cried suddenly	4.985384723254752e+16
 Only a little burnt	252207.7771207565


Cup of tea now	167836.92880912143
 Then he put a
forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant
meat	1.6783209260192253e+18
 Done to a turn	196533.96399705022
 Then he cut away dies of
bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth	1.0659077350849822e+21



Dearest Papli

Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present	3625265489443.052

 We did great biz yesterday	1952306.8944514797
 I hear them at the piano
downstairs	210853072.75611386
 There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday	57999962113203.73

There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his
cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan’s (I was on the
pop of writing Blazes Boylan’s) song about those seaside girls	1.155388642030927e+40
 Excuse bad writing am in hurry	13440331.183654094


                        M	139.2487574762866
 Curious, fifteenth of the month too	374543346.957295
 Separation	193.68270965874825

She knew at once	167037.1568127607
 Excuse bad writing	11863.09948438374
 Wouldn’t eat her cakes or speak or look	1558373717.02471
 Not much	1503.758069520916
 Of course it might	198143.1779008506
 Vain: very	15085.963181148989
 Anemic a
little	24772.828074525423
 Not a bit funky	256578.663547536
 Torn envelope	1184.882639871624
 Friend of the family	208480.9684828733

Pier with lamps, summer evening, band	2010635467.5747194


Milly too	1412.8932787490614
 Far away now past	146957.8529063203
 Will
happen, yes	188997.9067258709
 Prevent	193.68270965874825
 He felt the flowing qualm spread over him	2982349153.995534
 Useless to
move now	148220.5740258889
 Full gluey woman’s lips	180400.25862726633
 Or
through M’Coy	14817.315538949495

Wants to go out	180714.62700307375
 Wait before a door sometime it will open	2035376170.088608
 Has the fidgets	26405.79331187525
 Thunder in the air	202904.31785525152
 Was washing at her
ear with her back to the fire too	35596160063263.46


He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels	499496174732015.94


—Miaow! he said in answer	388413065.64088464


A paper	1700.1993553000652


In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_	96518770742681.38
 He folded it

 They tolled the hour: loud dark iron	2711848176.2613945
 Could have given that address too	17119318.723753985

He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through
Lime street	8613254112823880.0
 By Brady’s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket
of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt	4.236179758418912e+22
 O let him! His life
isn’t such a bed of roses	28865545061819.285

In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental
Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,
finest quality, family tea	5.177406859320513e+33
 His right hand
came down into the bowl of his hat	3472147304658.6284
 His fingers found quickly a card
behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket	5.69415934868064e+17


So warm	1458.2112576459922
 Lovely spot it
must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on,
cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them	7.770501167303015e+32

While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting
poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his
baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper	4.205147777551995e+37
 Went too far last time	1623704.7929561576

 Getting up in a
minute	1940589.8283605198


—_What’s wrong with him_? He said	440185958694.5244
 And, faith, he
filled up	341695663.19413716
 I couldn’t believe it when I
heard it	2708543901.936914
 I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it
in the Arch	4.034025144192461e+17
 He died on Monday, poor
fellow_	2823486460.8966985

 There’s a
drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself
would have to go down if the body is found	1.5462464884320177e+27
 I’d go if I possibly
could	15285161.394716
 Well, tolloll	26299.878144958315
 M’Coy will do	15019.522089384041


Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze	20603323.99313512
 The quick touch	17634.163802353483
 I’d
like my job	146999.0536980639


Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled	37362489126.91325
 Cheeseparing nose	1904.6415875888897
 Nice enough in
its way: for a little ballad	251689662447.42056
 You and me, don’t you
know: in the same boat	58881266041711.07
 Softsoaping	193.68270965874825

herself be vaccinated again	2348529746.738736
 Your wife and my wife	1981322.838537361


Wonder is he pimping after me?

Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured
hoardings	1.5875422092922805e+23
 Cantrell and Cochrane’s Ginger Ale (Aromatic)	4825517237.110371

scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham
recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face	1.0324252502639008e+24


Every word is so deep, Leopold	215448538.63254526


Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the
hazard	1.046527973789814e+16
 Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid
the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss	7.627477501613151e+19
 Poor jugginses! Damn
all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in
nosebags	7.891049605204456e+19
 Too full for words	165998.3791866505
 Still they get their feed all right and
their doss	327601829567.3067
 Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp
between their haunches	372695415364535.3
 Might be happy all the same that way	2580164983.212921
 Good poor

 Like to give them an odd cigarette	175894956.1465163



He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in
the lee of the station wall	1.7280754571714304e+22
 No-one	137.08760925992965

Ruins and tenements	21683.515125050824

you did not like my last letter	239096176148.96277

 Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you
so often you have no idea	5.3379230898957705e+19

 Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it
back in his sidepocket	6.367223441755389e+18
 Changed since the first letter	1702261.4528619929

 Cigar has a cooling effect	2139218.567847173


Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it	7611228077098026.0
 No roses

Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head	235217357.89389503


     O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers	39228080667.63694

     She didn’t know what to do

 Now could you make out a thing like that?

     To keep it up	5039065692126572.0


Martha, Mary	16958.95178578831
 He is sitting in their house, talking	3100580137.94132

Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen	24898395444.120163


Nice kind of evening feeling	1530384.0591321078
 Tell about places you have
been, strange customs	31837226876.879734
 She listens with big dark soft eyes	261105246.1738403
 Long long long rest	149242.80110130174


Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly
in shreds and scattered them towards the road	8.673299816389833e+23

 Fifteen
millions of barrels of porter	15145436.05167485


What am I saying barrels? Gallons	165047680.75955635

Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside	39370253740583.52
 The
bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing
together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy
pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth	5.364331124805494e+39

 He stopped at each, took out a
communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it
neatly into her mouth	1.6914236825221765e+33
 Her hat and head sank	1812922.7764403995

 He approached a bench and seated himself in
its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper	3.795421786463595e+17
 They were about him here
and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for
it to melt in their stomachs	2.9522180809962804e+27
 Now I bet it makes
them feel happy	1878687497.714469

Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself	1.0085069497567716e+25


Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:

—What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows	3163515913360550.5


All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by
passers	20957994114585.82


—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding

—He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him	1.1937489529445806e+17
 Martin Cunningham began to brush away
crustcrumbs from under his thighs	2498169867254.4595
 Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward
and said:

 There’s the sun again coming

—We’re off again	172850.18339498094
 Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard	471964919461.25415

 Where is it?

—In the paper this morning	435843280965.7501


Mr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the
deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what
Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s? no, Sexton,
Urbright	1.1050476754330017e+54
 Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper	41916006334.78379

A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a

 Not much grief there	150779.1641193635

They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s, under the railway
bridge, past the Queen’s theatre: in silence	2.0498079921163107e+24

Just that moment I was thinking	20481555.5661304
 From the door of the Red Bank the
white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed	7.95277226288359e+22


Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
hand	9.536726248284668e+17
 They sometimes
feel what a person is	212282204.30095133

 My nails	1420.596485959921

 What causes
that? I suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh

 The shape is there still	2162073.4066979894

He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant
glance over their faces	5.9548270457045434e+19


Mr Power asked:

—How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?

—O, very well, Mr Bloom said	1.6543646469304912e+26
 I hear great accounts of it	20093010.68104117
	13.951045332398436


—Are you going yourself?

—Well no, Mr Bloom said	542020201319757.6
 What you lose on one you can make up on the other	42987339930810.31


—Quite so, Martin Cunningham said	251028059.45008296
 Mary Anderson is up there now	26450781.292921927

 You would imagine that would get played

 Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her

 Or the
Moira, was it?

They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator’s form	1.51528812040665e+16


—In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said	550498576014.8401


—We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly	4613375596150.384
 Isn’t it awfully good?

—What is that? Mr Dedalus asked	385718781940834.0
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436


—Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried	258292156.15654594
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436
 Is he dead?

—Dead! Martin Cunningham cried	276435800696.4654
 Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished
him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father
on the quay more dead than alive	3.520246394268279e+35
 Half the town was there	2094907.7412551146


—Yes, Mr Bloom said	31351067.271426298
 But the funny part is	2120187.4376364537
	13.951045332398436
	13.951045332398436


—And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
saving his son’s life	8.528161263012634e+20


—O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed	33124797660.823776
 Like a hero	17249.749190599843
 A silver florin	14998.301407005483


—Isn’t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly	247644418853.54858


—One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily	3165955121223.906


Nelson’s pillar	1183.5908436789312


—Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!

—We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said	9.586484106033935e+24


—Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh	6.720304158537018e+17

Many a good one he told himself	234738141.76958033
 Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last
and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this	8.375448620055153e+30
 He went
very suddenly	167409.74527306703


—Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said	33818518.30692556


He tapped his chest sadly	1481713.2282137466


—He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said	57660986961061.38


—No suffering, he said	43209413.71009679
 A moment and all is over	28445044.44935916


Dead side of the street this	23836714.835019413

—The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added	486565292332431.7


—Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively	10186700039734.137
 We
must take a charitable view of it	2214709678.3849177
 Looking away now	14500.549434073413

 Lord, she must have

He looked away from me	1987539.9412670264

No more pain	14752.16441506781


—God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said	6009320708086542.0
 That will be worth seeing, faith	205621204.26803523
 He left me on my ownio	31297809.777577426

 From one extreme to the other	37887641.628575124


—What’s wrong now?

A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching
by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony
croups	5.120595732478583e+34
 Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their
fear	3221212509839.7847


—Huuuh! the drover’s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks	2.397988613511649e+16
 Springers	193.68270965874825

soap, margarine	1516937078470.4092


The carriage moved on through the drove	254992021.20985916
 All those animals could be taken
in trucks down to the boats	60058989839036.805
 Quite
right	1379.3151109693392
 They ought to	17808.895847692605
 Run the line
out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage
and all	5.307618889815683e+19


—That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell
about the road	7.439187532503264e+19


Bom! Upset	19514.32790018464
 Asking what’s up
now	144383.29603872768
 Quite right to close it	1793461.2848989936
 Looks horrid open	12354.942451016204
 Much better to close up all the orifices	3376888196.236019
 Yes, also	19487.36469297422

With wax	1472.8632023286348


—Dunphy’s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right	2827188124809.7017
 Tiptop position for a pub	1503558.4725886844
 Pass round the consolation	253807.70153096103

 Still some might ooze out of an artery	4051680345.2366548


In silence they drove along Phibsborough road	222825185.9375802


Water rushed roaring through the sluices	32961026.799626023
 A man stood on his dropping
barge, between clamps of turf	62211576762177.39
 On the towpath by the lock a
slacktethered horse	62240494578.91862
 Aboard of the _Bugabu	5230242.13934387

Their eyes watched him	1996876.3930848106
 On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on
his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of
reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs	1.1376338276855575e+35

 Left him weeping, I suppose?

—Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear	7.953480559187015e+21


The stonecutter’s yard on the right	36191428.66085397
 Last lap	1345.802276896183
 Crowded on the spit of
land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,
knelt in grief, pointing	1.953404743727275e+26
 Fragments of shapes, hewn	5928812.883404563

—That is where Childs was murdered, he said	564818615647.3237
 The last house	19375.161336492198


—The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said	362704307163.1684


—Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added	290585039.18643564
 That’s the maxim of the
law	40757596.1201816
 It passed darkly	22457.542150982325
 Whole place gone to hell	1554220.8482344532
 Murder	130.37678284299378
 How she met her death	1734260.1584332807

Murderer is still at large	1564180.1350685344


The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze	39807799134.78537
 Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the
trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain
gestures on the air	2.2785527178571475e+27


The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped	4888919509.133252
 Martin Cunningham put
out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with
his knee	9.618733230545026e+21


Change that soap now	153485.9656518192
 Mr Bloom’s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket	7.136066132057243e+19

He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand
still held	7.40635728466865e+16
 It’s all the same	207921.29429185123
 Pomp of death	15022.238136337322
 Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes
walking after them	2393045151878.224
 The waggoner marching at their head saluted	265392451.91642103
 Then Mount

 So
much dead weight	138042.26078607445
 Corny Kelleher and the boy
followed with their wreaths	22204941242.803135
 How so?

—His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered	28376908856885.043
 You heard him say he was going to Clare	42034745759.209335


—O God! Mr Power whispered	199602250.01225248


—Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked	4327462138.286568
 Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane	50421128352.87308


—How many children did he leave?

—Five	259720746204.9099
 Five young children	13608.575721262214


—A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added	39989380682163.984


—Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed	239541664.9292685


He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished	4880236445178.186
 More dead for her than for me	218931397.37944442
 One must
outlive the other	2989540.5853477065
 Wise men say	13427.54173340266
 Your terrible loss	19185.161876624858
 I hope you’ll soon follow

 Him? No	19238.89168293779

 Frogmore memorial mourning	25619.267665005133

 Consort not even a king	2487859.5307730427
 It never comes	16267.325191519209
 One must go first: alone, under the ground:
and lie no more in her warm bed	6.118866793124342e+20


—And how is Dick, the solid man?

—Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered	7.135363152775322e+21
 Dick Tivy bald?

—Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,
pointing ahead	2.0454341565984256e+25
 Just to keep them going till the
insurance is cleared up	2581287920720.391


—Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously	55708866408.967224
 Is that the eldest boy in front?

—Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife’s brother	2.117783282011633e+21
 I often told poor Paddy he ought
to mind that job	2399283144519.5493


They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel	28178003031.68108
 Mr Bloom stood
behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and
at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar	2.6054098680016247e+27
 All he might have done	1934512.9432349156
 Which end is his head?

After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened
light	1.3943830299539965e+22
 The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow
candles at its corners	3.855189822295482e+18
 Always in front of us	2011533.5707293667
 Corny Kelleher, laying a
wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel	1.8156620102309255e+19
 The mourners
knelt here and there in prayingdesks	3542217908.8017693
 Mr Bloom stood behind near the
font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper
from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it	1.1524008379990256e+31


A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a
door	3.5682609118510396e+16
 I knew his name was like a coffin	2724873716.1895914
 Thou art Peter	12120.309511824898
 Burst
sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will	3294737163441.3394
 Crape weepers	2686.4209888162945
 What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after
cabbage	28736688759222.773
 Air of the place maybe	2101189.1957577686
 Must be an
infernal lot of bad gas round the place	3183624829112.2876
 Down in the
vaults of saint Werburgh’s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have
to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn
it	5.594023621970221e+34
 Ow	129.54112976387725
 That’s better	1434.0553103128427


The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s
bucket and shook it over the coffin	2.3272708595389844e+26
 Then he came back and put it back in the bucket	4126280223352.3047


_—Et ne nos inducas in tentationem	5649089590.029211
_

The server piped the answers in the treble	31479991417.11523
	13.951045332398436


Holy water that was, I expect	245216186.4958872
 He must be fed
up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up	7.44450275950699e+20

What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over	29846824645845.914
 On Dignam

_—In paradisum	335050.5688476065
 Tiresome kind of a job	1775423.0614037842
 Corny
Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law	595220120871828.2
 All
followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air	47713492963047.914
 The metal
wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt
boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres	1.581548326006828e+28


The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo	1247551915871.3052
 Lord, I mustn’t lilt here	18503284.612330705


Mr Power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone	461221981861135.7
 But
his heart is buried in Rome	213128543.83706194
 How many broken hearts are buried here,
Simon!

—Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said	6.572069675689474e+23
 I’ll soon be stretched
beside her	14715110.239127478


Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
in his walk	8.625989732078459e+18
 Mr Power took his arm	1748398.0199280442


—She’s better where she is, he said kindly	346677610627.4906


—Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely	4250227447.646451


—The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said	38963873405286.37
 I suppose we can
do so too	209264735.73213595


—The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don’t you think?
Mr Kernan said with reproof	8.755557520807423e+20


Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes	331649869924.8338
 Secret
eyes, secretsearching	252048.15116586204
 In the same boat	205419.972311168

day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and
the rest of his traps	1.5270895013299482e+25
 Find damn all of himself that morning	204297658.62731916
 Troy
measure	1180.2805752504262


—Everything went off A1, he said	4037410174.534898
 What?

He looked on them from his drawling eye	455446017217.88495
 Policeman’s shoulders	1215.300246371341
 With
your tooraloom tooraloom	142761.90973126798


—What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said	2325283890.5431137


Mr Kernan assured him	148627.8204073301
 I
know his face	201390.92325074438
 She was a finelooking woman	3073269.380837135


—What is he? he asked	340153265.7864607
 What does he do? Wasn’t he in the stationery
line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls	2.63116364073325e+27


—Has still, Ned Lambert said	249912203.02721554


John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead	167454851.56828433
 A portly man, ambushed among the
grasses, raised his hat in homage	1.3260102228057934e+16
 The gravediggers touched their caps	2356356.2511127708
 Mr Dedalus said:

—I am come to pay you another visit	365299791844637.94


They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear	30329010114887.797
 They asked for
Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried	3618950714648850.5
 The other drunk was
blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up	4.182943295507437e+19


The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed	7424708613869.8


Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher,
accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as
he walked	3.341249150195688e+29


—That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes	325218609496170.1
 I know that	19481.395135475366


Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk	355712875.24116033
 All want to be on
good terms with him	27909879405.923225
 _Habeas corpus_	262023.2058370118
 That’s
the first sign when the hairs come out grey	389014665332.5416
 And temper getting cross	216245.19900209137

Silver threads among the grey	2338593.5523479935
 Fancy being his wife	151748.35643216418
 Wonder he had the
gumption to propose to any girl	627701904403.655
 It might thrill her first	1700977.0234941817
 Courting death	1243.4735021348897
 The
shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O’Connell must be
a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy
man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark	2.536565204287963e+44
 Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at
all	4597774016811.783
 Tell her a ghost story in bed to
make her sleep	2641471212360.119
 Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I have	3863868552052.6255
 It was a
pitchdark night	3181319.3147619455
 Whores in Turkish graveyards	196701.59575670018
 You might pick up a young widow here	2026080004.2050447

Men like that	17115.045208247222
 Love among the tombstones	249724.01651501926

 Tantalising for the
poor dead	2938887.717896681
 Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving	681903306.7672092
 Desire to grig people	215115.9502986544
 More room if they buried them standing	144185963.19656628
 Chinese cemeteries with giant
poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me	376671374407206.25
 Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure,
invaluable for fruit garden	792457901924265.9
 A bargain	1585.964045475274
 With thanks	1547.3399113192577


I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,
nails	5.908571648554546e+17
 Turning green and pink decomposing	2063981.7217645517
 Rot
quick in damp earth	2034104.7638553935
 The lean old ones tougher	2332214.764584491
 Of course the cells or whatever
they are go on living	3896476102651.019
 Live for ever practically	140919.55327039282


But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots	6822637131835.218
 Those pretty little
seaside gurls	1776918.289771962
 Gives him a sense of
power seeing all the others go under first	301780258113720.1
 Wonder how he looks at
life	18059161.520999976
 Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart	5993615957730.52
 Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a	24914501.594233453
 this morning	1487.7193597049197
 The dead themselves the
men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what’s
in fashion	5.081567109257236e+22
 You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way	235090785279.72314

Gravediggers in _Hamlet_	3331409.3211372835

 _De mortuis
nil nisi prius_	491344237.6254808

Seems a sort of a joke	20920232.578112684
 Read your own obituary notice they say you live
longer	226515839849.6722
 New lease of life	241146.51012481685


—How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked	3272566357584.944
 The barrow had ceased to
trundle	27311319.955549173
 The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole,
stepping with care round the graves	7.808950229444988e+19
 The gravediggers bore the coffin
and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it	3.0190656412360796e+20
 We all do	17124.63097644288
 Bury the dead	16700.35900275692
 Say Robinson Crusoe was
true to life	367792905.7254273

They’re so particular	12869.205129048696
 Lay me in my native earth	17568537.6156545
 Bit of clay from the
holy land	215846354.09532472
 Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one
coffin	45247766356665.48
 I see	1702.2874585212412
 To protect him as long as possible

Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit	24521173963.248257
 Tinge of purple	21705.612686022534
 Used to change three suits in the day	2296670884.214865
 Must get that grey
suit of mine turned by Mesias	180362590087.50433
 It’s dyed	1287.6305713256986
 His wife I forgot he’s
not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for
him	7.501332713747608e+20
 They struggled up and out: and all uncovered	65511404225.077705
 Twenty	131.6791658112188


Far away a donkey brayed	3323387.293156607
 No such ass	13730.047399073266
 Shame of death	15480.96985718176


Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper	1910741853825.3804
 Whisper	129.00818322044617
 The
boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in
the black open space	8.899289091539737e+19
 Wellcut frockcoat	1769.5873749099078
 It’s the moment
you feel	2134528.3668728583
 Mistake
must be: someone else	15082932.48235686
 Try the house opposite	172317.25021001737
 Wait, I wanted to	2494994.799618912
 Would you like to see a priest? Then rambling and
wandering	51923162632845.82
 Press his lower eyelid	132203.4026305763
 Shall I nevermore behold thee_?
Bam! He expires	6808957849869.972
 Remember him in your prayers	1786153.5168859656
 Ivy day dying out	203833.01961477989


Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do
when you shiver in the sun	7.4820765922215785e+22
 Callboy’s warning	1759.6182118542392
 Mamma,
poor mamma, and little Rudy	2396021977.709357


The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in
on the coffin	1.2197658782550152e+18
 Mr Bloom turned away his face	20305084.700917885
 And if he was alive all
the time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of
course	5.906997541990959e+31
 Of course he is dead	2245287.675290418
 Three days	1387.6849547058196
 Begin to be forgotten	160403.6761929829


The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat	29741419686227.977
 Had enough of
it	205473.32420946675
 Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make
its way deftly through the maze of graves	1.5180281582425781e+22


—I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath	363504161845293.6
 And you might put down M’Coy’s name too	2137891712.1460652
 I know	1690.0331766146858
 Levanted with the cash of a few ads	3520301594.9935474

Charley, you’re my darling	1691526.405414817
 That was why he asked me to	288808035.8128483
 O well, does
no harm	19950353.498845723
	13.951045332398436


He looked around	16170.786790561613


—Macintosh	1539.3444589662122
 Where is he now?

—M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling	7487858354667.427
 I don’t know who he is	24788820.032173015
 Is that his
name?

He moved away, looking about him	45078990613519.83
 What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign	5143632360565.488
 Become invisible	1148.8682075035533
 It rose	1594.4256871454513

A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested
their spades	1.9351850328366648e+18
 All uncovered again for a few instants	420367471.0184034
 The
gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards
the barrow	8116265921798338.0
 One, leaving his
mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing	1.0827091174137546e+18

Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband	6598975084.6566515
 His navelcord	2272.6654216455468

Thanks in silence	15635.290402084638
 Sorry, sir: trouble	1971505.7803477638
 Headshake	193.68270965874825
 For
yourselves just	22576.390183693657


The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying
at whiles to read a name on a tomb	9.27783409402955e+23
 More sensible to spend the money on
some charity for the living	43738197866726.81
 Then lump them together to save time	169523903.21253735
 All souls’ day	150611.7511589847
 Ten shillings for the gardener	2759256.777950718
 Near death’s door	12422.092410485371
 Who departed this
life	223433.67190682585
 As if they did it of their own accord	24087021816.91839
 So and So, wheelwright	3549611.0447675646
 I travelled for cork lino	3229934.9493463705
 I paid
five shillings in the pound	216284266.2925759
 Or a woman’s with her saucepan	30683197.796284977
 Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that
poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell	1.8662456015244847e+21
 Old Dr Murren’s	19752.95369575056
 The great physician called him
home	28223841.107150894
 Newly
plastered and painted	193315.6352532793
 Rusty wreaths
hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil	52283708114.2638

Still, the flowers are more poetical	355837494.9964794
 Like the
wedding present alderman Hooper gave us	2287309610.343655

Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him	322681079480.71185
 Dead animal even
sadder	173889.31069797007
 Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen
matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave	2.6890111012944918e+23
 Heart on his sleeve	170789.23573656013
 Ireland was
dedicated to it or whatever that	3407415472.669204
 Faithful departed	1801.4422901371709
 Remind you of the voice like the photograph
reminds you of the face	528044412294189.56
 For instance who? For instance some fellow that
died when I was in Wisdom Hely’s	3.3899241151416384e+17
 Wait	139.5845861037148
 Stop!

He looked down intently into a stone crypt	294992452753.75745
 There he
goes	17172.52986158824
 Robert Emmet was
buried here by torchlight, wasn’t he? Making his rounds	4958098305529249.0
 I read in that
_Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a
corpse	1.1517854237670467e+22
 Cremation better	1950.544196866129
 Devilling for the
other firm	2739057.5367634892
 Time of the
plague	207073.42541468126
 Can’t
bury in the air however	19212123.725695286
 Out of a flying machine	1886426.637000025
 Wonder does the news
go about whenever a fresh one is let down	279464480521345.34
 Wouldn’t be surprised	13405.09383121169
 Regular square feed
for them	1347201.7847366328
 Flies come before he’s well dead	14390026.078546569
 They
wouldn’t care about the smell of it	2775959172.35266


The gates glimmered in front: still open	3177325802.22804
 Back to the world again	2450157.791749083

Enough of this place	173716.16684709542
 I will appear to you after
death	225051545.42726356
 You will see my ghost after death	188739396.37476146
 My ghost will haunt you after
death	248469294.73764625
 I do not like
that other world she wrote	25843463772.204098
 No more do I	191101.7709574462
 Feel live warm beings near you	20909661.64328643


Solicitor, I think	192318.85346315673

 Heart of gold really	165009.87682694604
 Got
his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside
him	4460563603225386.0
 Pure fluke of mine: the bias	447846839.267849
 Hate at first sight	139531.37843088043


They stopped	1463.2970296005603


—Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing	38938516992212.305


John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment	26225587338.191875


—Thank you, he said shortly	431422961.2485329


They walked on towards the gates	21638252.467018753
 Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a
few paces so as not to overhear	8.872762755293165e+16
 Martin laying down the law	2658488.3122332096
 Martin
could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his
seeing it	6.021031817821668e+17


Thank you	1529.774386990088
 How grand we are this morning!

IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS


Before Nelson’s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started
for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure,
Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines,
Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold’s Cross	3.0466980845707403e+64
 The hoarse Dublin United
Tramway Company’s timekeeper bawled them off:

—Rathgar and Terenure!

—Come on, Sandymount Green!

Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a
singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided
parallel	2.5029190772363945e+51
 Parked in North Prince’s street His Majesty’s vermilion
mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E	1.3164588340967144e+21
, received
loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured
and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery	6.1609301115777496e+29
 On the brewery float bumped
dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince’s
stores	2.8016450387033228e+16
 Alexander Keyes	1182.7825173241863


—Just cut it out, will you? Mr Bloom said, and I’ll take it round to
the _Telegraph_ office	2.063252536341406e+26
 Scissors and paste	21463.626346268622


—I’ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut
square	8.825137040896592e+16
 I’ll rub that in	176339.02301006063


WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT


Red Murray touched Mr Bloom’s arm with the shears and whispered:

—Brayden	1.5270505093749007e+25

Dullthudding Guinness’s barrels	16100.60813412145
 It passed statelily up the staircase,
steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face	8.105217997077491e+17
 The broadcloth back
ascended each step: back	4185025654.2413807
 Welts of flesh behind on him	29174529.444459554
 Fat folds of neck,
fat, neck, fat, neck	37246619624802.836


—Don’t you think his face is like Our Saviour? Red Murray whispered	2579784388446799.5


The door of Ruttledge’s office whispered: ee: cree	472155000947.5364
 They always build
one door opposite another for the wind to	2591750196040.163
 Way out	1538.2441917804883

 Working away, tearing away	2354339.3013231065


HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT


Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman’s spare body, admiring a glossy
crown	4.625562064210379e+22


Strange he never saw his real country	178673776.66958547

The foreman moved his pencil towards it	203992627.97362843
 He doesn’t hear it	184146.47677693714

Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert’s quizzing
face, asked of it sourly:

—Agonising Christ, wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse?

Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:

—_Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on
its way, tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling
waters of Neptune’s blue domain, ’mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest

o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the

by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in	1.7337767625182151e+25
 The bold blue eyes stared
about them and the harsh voice asked:

—What is it?

—And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said

—Drink! the editor cried	23037391.736218967

—North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece	8.072781890397422e+17
 We
won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!

—Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at
his toecaps	1.1996366839888335e+30


—So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed	488268689567.034

O, HARP EOLIAN!


He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking
off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant
unwashed teeth	1.8130316315878185e+38


—Bingbang, bangbang	420125.083553908

 O’Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip

Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was
flung open	7.097130610689179e+16


Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin
by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the
steps	2.857827876972875e+28
 It was the big fellow shoved me, sir	33955338829.214756

 He came in quickly and bumped
against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue	5.4330430379356256e+17


—_Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and
making a grimace	1.2750747703448835e+21


—My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip	5656713601716.835
 Are you hurt? I’m in a

 O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan’s hand and read them,
blowing them apart gently, without comment	3.1220099424737812e+19


—He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his
blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind	8.026918666827625e+19


—Show	1671.456740312704
 Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window	31781407730.907192


A STREET CORTÈGE


Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr
Bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a
tail of white bowknots	1.4931132618510166e+38


—Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said,
and you’ll kick	9.18774036595814e+19
 O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his
receiving hands	31535597033.44609


—What’s that? Myles Crawford said with a start	293522280952.2652
 Where are the other two
gone?

—Who? the professor said, turning	6.64460258614339e+16
 Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall	249407034.98745814


—He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice	377166414916554.3


—Seems to be, J	28030092.960771427
 Who has the
most matches?

THE CALUMET OF PEACE


He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself	1.1684991223059885e+23
 Lenehan
promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn	206900621667512.38

 O’Molloy opened his case again and offered it	2042858024.7106354


The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow	6.3069577396901224e+16


He took a cigarette from the open case	2717143025.051997
 The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire	300725489492.1999


—That’s it, he said	33895310.779333234
 You and I are the fat in the fire	48738230413.72167

We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell	414948867068.6458


THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME


—Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws	6.613195602205927e+19


He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:

—What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile	7.077080974545942e+26

umbrella:

 Is he dotty?

—His name is Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr

—What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy	4644494999672.92
 Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris
lies from virgin Dublin	2639759948024417.5
 Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_,
returning to the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?

John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge	3.0214740541527664e+37


—It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a
swift glance their hearing	1.840925696838776e+24

 Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!

—The play begins	412587308528493.8
 It is
the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare
who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not
vanity in order to play the part of the spectre	3.347054356415117e+47

—She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born	525007240111334.9
 She
bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids
closed when he lay on his deathbed	5.5138011315065016e+23
 The sheeted mirror	24588.925862881104
 What useful discovery did Socrates learn
from Xanthippe?

—Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts
into the world	2.9769902379895566e+28
 Yes, we seem
to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her	429995672774260.75

He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling
_The girl I left behind me	2.920295854220519e+22
 Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a
passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose

—Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,

Stephen sat down	15246.037873251998


He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:

—Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?

Alarmed face asks me	1.0596490619199068e+54
 Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase	76753706413.1009

—As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,
from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the
artist weave and unweave his image	1.346374301855587e+41
 And as the mole on my right breast
is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of
new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father
the image of the unliving son looks forth	1.18378141366669e+50
 I feel Hamlet quite young	1551645.340830615


—That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing	668845386123233.9
 The plays of Shakespeare’s later years which Renan
admired so much breathe another spirit	2140248101160334.0


—There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a

—His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of

 He will see in them
grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself	6.817318736467447e+16
 Oddly
enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of
the sonnets	1.163801377212729e+19


Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk’s egg,
prize of their fray	1.091949015749914e+20
 Dost love, Miriam? Dost
love thy man?

—That may be too, Stephen said	7.0400221614226596e+19

 Assumed dongiovannism will

I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new
passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own
understanding of himself	8.663460363527726e+37


—The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
porch of a sleeping ear	1.2095174229231946e+21
 But those who are done to death in sleep
cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their
souls with that knowledge in the life to come	1.5205134484924026e+32
 The poisoning and the
beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet’s ghost could not know
of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator	1.3338782791653566e+29
 Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with
him from Lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen’s breast, bare,
with its mole cinquespotted	1.1522751943946138e+32
 He goes back, weary of the creation he has
piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore	6.666096486348365e+26
 He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind
by Elsinore’s rocks or what you will, the sea’s voice, a voice heard
only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son
consubstantial with the father	8.804405465887203e+49

Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however
for man’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our

The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,

Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds
over Rathcoffey	6.469903366426228e+16
 His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of
Clongowes field	6229270273787.627

An ivory bookmark told him the page	262449155.25435653

He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he
came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas:

Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his

Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping
eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner	1.8653741269442643e+26
 He pulled himself erect,
went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
furnishings	1.244160637090936e+24
 Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came
to the doorway	6.236088013510006e+16


Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat
downtilted, chewing his blade of hay	6.425431441865476e+19

The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased	7.323458987338774e+16

It fell on the path	2201451.5187605233


One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the
minstrel’s cap, saying:

—There, sir	2.728465297544903e+27


—Did you put in the books? Boody asked	315165292612.5039

Boody cried angrily:

Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:

—And what’s in this?

A heavy fume gushed in answer	1.0209321738840095e+45


—Where did you get it? Katey asked	26452883708.78566
 Katey,

 It’s for an invalid	235352.93061645853

Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse	22023347330.859127

Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches	172662523972.35226

Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall
Lenehan showed M’Coy how the whole thing was	7.053470293057127e+20
 One of those manholes
like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it,

it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired	3.04555446866907e+28

—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said	3.0208780935292508e+16
 Father Cowley
brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand	5733170518818.215
 I’m barricaded up, Simon, with
two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance	7.933898111239966e+19
 A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance	416154828.13229984


—With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked	53510575651900.59
 Reuben of that ilk	250789.98012694635
 He’s going to say a word to long John to get
him to take those two men off	5.163996432213738e+19


He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in
his neck	5.317681416523022e+19


—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding	40076597756.731865


—There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets	8555034316288406.0


Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops
crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge	2.6956188972329946e+22
 He came towards
them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails	761222139350703.9


—And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked	1.0976710048288848e+17


—That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone	681264722395881.0
 Not too dusty? What?

He turned to both	287101505086.07227

of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright	7.501644536740318e+38
 Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?

—He has, Father Cowley said	6287494906363188.0

 Love is the name?

—That’s right, Father Cowley said	45091385223783.6

—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he
said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk	2.1269788945249683e+23
 Damned Irish language,
language of our forefathers	2806373781.7701416


Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to
the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held
his peace	1.267328167755421e+31


—What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked	270439150172.97037


Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot	306583604671.784

 Uff! Ooo! Mind!

Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and
passed in and up the stairs	3.086168175851169e+26

He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word	65282755544077.08


As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat
brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,
having buffeted a thewless body	4.509479773672087e+33

 Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he

Bronze by gold, miss Douce’s head by miss Kennedy’s head, over the
crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing
steel	6.251897514530988e+31


Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de Nil	5.100947550612262e+18


—Who? Where? gold asked more eagerly	22979633004.347656


He’s looking	1411.8117993848177


Her wet lips tittered:

—He’s killed looking back	273855377837.15958


She laughed:

—O wept! Aren’t men frightful idiots?

With sadness	6741605808003927.0
 Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a
hair	26071635340539.18


A man	1847.1878134979468


The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came	961564128362055.2
 For them
unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china	4119955345599195.5


—What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked	37192726918.066246


—Your _beau,_ is it?

A haughty bronze replied:

—I’ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your
impertinent insolence	9.600222806032642e+34


On her flower frowning miss Douce said:

—Most aggravating that young brat is	6.159905571919718e+16
 If he doesn’t conduct himself
I’ll wring his ear for him a yard long	3403480371928976.0


—Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined	2922962457.5226893


She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea	624260370366476.2
 They cowered
under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned,
waiting for their teas to draw	1.8903450143803872e+23
 They pawed their blouses, both of black
satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and
seven	2.5655514587706408e+29


—Am I awfully sunburnt?

Miss bronze unbloused her neck	4138371656058.9546
 Did you try the borax with
the cherry laurel water?

Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror
gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their
midst a shell	2.3501571872511905e+38


—And leave it to my hands, she said	485942599349.7522
 I asked that
old fogey in Boyd’s for something for my skin	63369276602256.914


—I won’t listen, she cried	259738640.10518205


But Bloom?

Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey’s tone:

—For your what? says he	1.4749568554195195e+20
 The hideous old wretch! That
night in the Antient Concert Rooms	59960570197840.13


She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea	1.9913266523465626e+18
 Miss Douce
huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a
snout in quest	9.984571706336982e+17


—O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried	3335070195.049098
 Why do I always think
Figather? Gathering figs, I think	51700760511339.33

In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy
your other eye	7.398557073177958e+16
 They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let
freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other,
high piercing notes	3.966567222045713e+30


Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and
gigglegiggled	9562227114010788.0
 Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her
nose and rolled droll fattened eyes	1.015918295127452e+19

With his bit of beard!

Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,
delight, joy, indignation	2.821124260602387e+29
 And then laughed more	183064.55583076386
 Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and
pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge	2.2406653380263663e+21
 You horrid thing!

And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly	5.20732051224183e+17
 Religion pays	1157.8753501870583

Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus	15369689.988706714


He held her hand	185714.41618360303


He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor	4132906523.3772683
 Lying out on the
strand all day	216360114.3245348
 Tempting poor simple males	107017.3434451103


Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away	2195170736.123998


—Well now I am, he mused	2972332839.2001624


—You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer	45987127074226.21
 I think I’ll trouble
you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky	3.197704247817998e+16


Jingle	131.3125710535059


—With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed	24370133413.080196
 He blew through the flue two husky
fifenotes	3759625727.111553


—By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains	7.044698721439309e+16

a great tonic in the air down there	486715631772.9404
 But a long threatening comes at

 Mute	125.99707486527164


Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:

—_O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!_

—Was Mr Lidwell in today?

In came Lenehan	3.656786494036082e+34

—He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said	557330552413.027
 She answered:

—Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?

She asked	6.017800592840384e+19
 He was not	20038.184433574097
 Lenehan round the

 She took no
notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:

—Ah fox met ah stork	3.909815258572899e+26
 Miss Douce turned to her tea aside	167349213.11219087


Lenehan opened most genial arms	1809968.6653670056
 Who?

—Who may he be? he asked	379224003083.5548
 Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard	28697739537.310516


Dry	131.72589535370204


—I see, he said	34865630.54800361

Douce	3.915526083790442e+30

Lenehan’s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy	4162440872668.0396


She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn,
dreamily rose	1.470498269541913e+19

He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw	36037800647921.05
 But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer
hair, a bosom and a rose	1.1750963895987126e+20

Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her
bust, that all but burst, so high	9.57329195716446e+25


—O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch	55377288802077.57


—Why don’t you grow? asked Blazes Boylan	20558484704.504543
 Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe	2502464.8249351056


—Here’s fortune, Blazes said	20368878.663282856

Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce’s

Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord,
and lost and found it, faltering	5.530585379216661e+24


—Go on! Do! _Sonnez!_

Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee	1.3874740806420939e+23


_—Sonnez!_

—You’re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said	9029453129618.303


Boylan, eyed, eyed	2079996.0042386118
 His spellbound
eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by
mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses
shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with
sunnier bronze	6.539558806204884e+48

He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe	9.698593223194785e+20
 Bald Pat carried
two diners’ drinks, Richie and Poldy	2370305518624.3022

Cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the
various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus
heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime
premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,
cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,
champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from
pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy
vales of Thomond, from the M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and
lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the

The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a

then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers
shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of	2.3619138935646416e+27
 And one or two
sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the
females, hitting below the belt	1.8810811402112847e+26


So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty
starts mousing around by Joe and me	1.506059847791736e+25


—Afraid he’ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering	4681765882230.667


—No, says I	3028047.7938073007

Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from
us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and
compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_

bards	7.718247768001872e+57
 points out in an interesting
communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and
more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the
famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more
modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye	7.779652939983338e+53
 And Joe asked him would he have
another	2660769059.902757


Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking	31661541990.477474
 Arsing around from one
pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog
and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators	3.624260709195147e+30
 Are you sure you won’t have anything in
the way of liquid refreshment? says he	7.148307047081797e+17
 You see, he, Dignam, I
mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the
time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the
policy	2.081809308237823e+38


—The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom	1012835107806.6292


Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act
like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit
of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that
Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow
contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled
with his mortgagor under the act	4.645435226835428e+79


—Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however
slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is
founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to
request of you this favour	4.211777753055038e+54


—No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which
actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me
consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,
this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness
of the cup	1.3785624088313256e+61
 The goodness of your heart,
I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the
expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose
poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of
speech	4.1316006665649774e+50
 Boosed at five

So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and
the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen
sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his
sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the
guaranteed remedy for timber tongue	7.838913274541483e+58

A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian
O’Ciarnain’s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of
_Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the
importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and
ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race	9.54034381891615e+69
 The
venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the
attendance was of large dimensions	9.92840710109088e+19
 Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses,
having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the
discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty
plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy
rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses
(happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in
the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without
fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself	inf

 He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up
the odds and he swatting all the time	2.0922921187314026e+22


—We know him, says the citizen	3909692705.016739
 We know what put
English gold in his pocket	21657200150.221752


—True for you, says Joe	305137601.301796


And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the
blood, asking Alf:

—Now, don’t you think, Bergan?

—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf	8.300785863872822e+39
 Heenan and Sayers was only
a bloody fool to it	611852358314.993

It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were
scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns	1.711219125558609e+26

Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up
for it by superlative skill in ringcraft	5.1788725747269316e+23
 The men came to
handigrips	3066893.6596490624
 It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it	650053411328622.1
 The two
fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high	252151744227.23868
 The referee twice
cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his
footwork a treat to watch	5.843116562515892e+22
 After a brisk exchange of courtesies during
which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from
his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and
landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him
flat	2.1008018667165006e+48
 Amid tense expectation the
Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole
Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared
victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the
ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight	2.881910191326992e+49

 Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney’s
moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal
Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street	1.013672621421102e+41

shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding
defiance to the world	1.0804334746941101e+39

—Good health, Ned, says J	3084574021.591841


—-There he is again, says Joe	51151906197.76289


And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter
and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in
as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a
secondhand coffin	1.331912476763801e+50


—How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe	34192093444366.438


One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James
Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers
saying he’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob	3.4760569286143906e+40

Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him,
swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid	3.03038476609484e+34


—Who tried the case? says Joe	2637372589.8871946


—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes	7.111638359642976e+19
 Tell him a tale of woe about arrears
of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve
in tears on the bench	4.556477591894176e+32


—Ay, says Alf	2289016.500384906
 Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock
the other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for
the corporation there near Butt bridge	1.6673531661289334e+33
 No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment	304799977020.3352
 And he sat
him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the
brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in
and for the county of the city of Dublin	1.5245346424505138e+43
 And there sat with him the
high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of
the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen
and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of
Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the
tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte
and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and
true	inf
 And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should
well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined
between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and
true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss
the book	2.85871105299885e+56
 And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they
swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His
rightwiseness	4.01469929410868e+32
 And so Joe swore high
and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all	6.171945029911052e+19
 That’s the whole secret	174178.27518029307


—Very kind of you, says Bloom	3711324838.7567806


—The strangers, says the citizen	380771257.344238
 We let them come in	2038363.6062101098
 The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon
robbers here	844600313550.8655


—Decree _nisi,_ says J	6950590586.2194


And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a
spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling
after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite
and when	3.2205265355998e+47


—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_
with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint	6.578816808649673e+30

So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on
him as long as a late breakfast	4.527288972561823e+39


—It’s on the march, says the citizen	45531402587.69857
 To hell with the bloody brutal
Sassenachs and their _patois	6730402357854.098
 Any civilisation they have they stole from us	4012657151.230247

Tonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts	28555825.029755503


—The European family, says J	280820897.21310526
	13.951045332398436


And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:

—_Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!_

He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the
medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh
Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty
valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster
silent as the deathless gods	inf


—What’s up with you, says I to Lenehan	462743762932.3832
 You look like a fellow that had
lost a bob and found a tanner	6841146583795447.0


—Gold cup, says he	26767128.477707706

So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was
anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his
luck with his mangy snout up	5.79991870658092e+40


—Not there, my child, says he	45255305691.568756
 and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom
sticking in an odd word	5.092225936356459e+16

exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised
silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of

O’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with
the emperor Charles the Fifth himself	9.943867629936365e+75

 A nation is the same people living in the same

 So I just went round the back of the

letting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I
to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in

telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have
done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she’s

So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it
was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper
all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off
of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk
about selling Irish industries	7.582785076342739e+62

—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare
larder	1.3554629401178672e+20


—How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant
countenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun?

trencherman by his aspect	1.6542949445198175e+20
 Hast aught to give us?

Mine host bowed again as he made answer:

—What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of
venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s
head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a

You never saw the like of it in all your born puff	42314069489747.984
 The jarvey saved his life by
furious driving as sure as God made Moses	2911298166061069.5
 What? O, Jesus, he did	3685123840.969133


—Did I kill him, says he, or what?

And he shouting to the bloody dog:

—After him, Garry! After him, boy!

And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old
sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his
lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb	4.598050676469104e+76
 Many a time and
oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy
chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy
Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and
Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits
with caps to match and the name _H	4.484835055647819e+67
 M	139.2487574762866

For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very
noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little
fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them	9.183775332509826e+36
 And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to
and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with
delight	1.9032132945162385e+24


—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said	2963149489.5380573
 Say out big, big	2054383.0770126027
 I want a drink of
water	24780532.95385834
 And Edy Boardman
laughed too at the quaint language of little brother	38154632684982.73


—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively	466582216909.26404
 At once! And you,
Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand	6.4272370357182915e+19
 Wait till I
catch you for that	235978100.33051455


His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for
their big sister’s word was law with the twins	1.0978670702349147e+24
 And in a sad plight he
was too after his misadventure	8227100484911.842
 His little man-o’-war top and
unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the
art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one
speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit	5.450513324399872e+44


She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:

—What’s your name? Butter and cream?

—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman	2.651943311872634e+34


—Nao, Tommy said	2145623.6101682503


Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy
Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman
couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes	3.533605966860003e+37
 Her figure was slight and
graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had
been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the
Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges
she used to get and that tired feeling	1.2318449077446117e+55
 There
was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which
was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep	1.5521473223941474e+28

Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in
her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education
Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the
land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow
and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their
devoirs to her	1.5004220866416386e+74
 Why have women such eyes of witchery?
Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and
dark expressive brows	1.8974119445181688e+27
 It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful
page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try
eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so
becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it	2.041773554262525e+51


For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes	2018997257706.5864
 She was
about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue	787181912298726.5
 She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy
say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a
lovers’ quarrel	3.846912825710755e+31
 Wylie who
was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university	17766065214536.22
 They were protestants in his family
and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed
Virgin and then Saint Joseph	9.806294962448967e+25
 But he was undeniably handsome with an
exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the
shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would
know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the
bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice
perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size
too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so
frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front
of her bit of a garden	inf
 The paly light of evening falls
upon a face infinitely sad and wistful	806321324263406.2
 Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain	1960565.0602157786
 D	134.7968827882081
 He would not believe in
love, a woman’s birthright	476297712482.0262
 The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s
(he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an
arm round her waist she went white to the very lips	6.169005291002092e+38
 No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous
love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who
had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey,
and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her
to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort
her with a long long kiss	8.265136236976226e+78
 It would be like heaven	1876274.8825780486


And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was
just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his
little wife to be	8.05051288375938e+31
 He would be
tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a
husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed
sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their
honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in
a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both
have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and
before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a
good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes	inf
 But Tommy
said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with
the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said
it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if
you please	2.4504878170550948e+55
 Edy told him no, no and to be off
now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him	1.430693245201616e+26


—You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said	24219904037.86763
 But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way
like that from everyone always petting him	4.3804403742692155e+22
 But not a pin cared
Ciss	23391705.817980185


—Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of
her nose	3.7830053390899965e+22
 Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at
him	4.7374538608262784e+17


Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls	41631022.839527965
 There was none to come up to her for fun	297544268653.1551
 But she was
sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever
made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome	5.664838932604484e+31


And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the
pealing anthem of the organ	1.2396530466587007e+21
, rosary,
sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament	7527898265510.764
 They were there
gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most
edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,
after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the
immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her
to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin
of virgins	5.807613215059656e+78
 Over and over had she told herself that
as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp
because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window
dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking	1.2537959158883759e+51


And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,
Virgin most merciful	5.2237263834173997e+17
 Her
mother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom
and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have
had a group taken	7.184505128908125e+35
 No-one would have thought the end was so near	24131950262.939465
 Now
he was laid to rest	21933595.441004507
 And her mother said to him to let that be a
warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the
funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him
the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino,
artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and
always bright and cheery in the home	inf


A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the
house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in
gold	1.2320049335358188e+30
 It was Gerty who turned off the gas
at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of
that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime
Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days
where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a
threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with
oldtime chivalry through her lattice window	inf
 The colours were done something lovely	17555081.12896292
 She was in a
soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in
chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat	3.013252345687192e+25
 Needless to say poor Tommy was
not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was
sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted
the ball	1.244464737339327e+36
 The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then
threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the
slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the
rock	2.648725294860293e+39


—If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said	367972032847.71204


Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip	350997520.95775956
 Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else
to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking	4.342297083813885e+19
 Till then they had only exchanged
glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she
ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the
twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had
ever seen	8.179621338742028e+55


Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted
and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain
of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray
for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose	2.3012033252092155e+58


And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for
eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of
health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out
to be something great, they said	1.1667905137323614e+53
 Of course his infant majesty was most
obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:

—Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa	3.265904184039793e+25


Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out
of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little
brats of twins	2.4269372493788813e+35
 She gazed out towards the distant sea	196981428.5404064
 Wonderful eyes they were,
superbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer	8.127482812211582e+19
 Here was that of which she had so often dreamed	275247017823.2159
 The very
heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she
knew on the instant it was him	4.0484218169293555e+25
 If he had suffered, more sinned against
than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked
man, she cared not	3.6752436129267467e+33
 She was a womanly woman not like other flighty
girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they
hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she
could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the
past	1.2209833193604345e+56
 Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man,
crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for
herself alone	8.47460436361263e+33


Refuge of sinners	20792.255918070194
 Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the
stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue
banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping
Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes
cast down	2.1226167982028618e+55
 He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and
thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design
for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the
mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little
house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the
forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a
present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or
some place	inf
 Little
monkeys common as ditchwater	2742509.6001747926
 And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they
were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned	6.907083863702321e+25


—Jacky! Tommy!

Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very
last time she’d ever bring them out	1.4033936278404215e+31
 She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip
up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a
lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece
whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just
because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see
all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as
possible	inf
 _Tableau!_
That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that
to witness	1.296565140096754e+21
 Three and eleven she paid for those
stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday
before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was
looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had
neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his
head to see the difference for himself	1.404474935658625e+76


Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with
her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a
streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought
only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her
petticoat hanging like a caricature	6.314007344993501e+65
 Gerty just took off her hat for a
moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown
tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision,
in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness	3.5726108876510534e+45
 You would have to travel
many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that	8.075143755905695e+21
 Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was
why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no
concern of hers	1.617222772948279e+31
 I
was only wondering was it late	214599015.90648058


Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and
their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just
gave a gentle hint about its being late	1.7886282987550565e+36
 But Edy wanted to know
because they were told to be in early	300441045887458.75


Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the
right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to
it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry
his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the
sun was set	1.2675886056917585e+63
 It was getting
darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was
winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it
back and put his hands back into his pockets	5.901943984555256e+44
 If ever there was
undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to
be seen on that man’s face	9.39392299351136e+23
 Gerty winced sharply	26309.994181928858

A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn
immeasurable	3648350852767235.5
 It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet
way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded
little cat she was	2.1178240990298555e+32

Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she
sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them
to see	2.2711179353661762e+29


Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the
ringdove, but they cut the silence icily	2.8828267720017035e+23
 As
for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck
him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as
much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a
dozen pieces	4.573652923784791e+50

Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty
could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a
towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft
had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was
something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and
never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it
so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it	inf


Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked
in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because
the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior	7.733746066488877e+40
 And Cissy told
him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and
baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and
Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby,
without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and
sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib	2.074990671349198e+75


—O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss	36404872668.00455


Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy
asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was
flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed
it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction
because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet
seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that
Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the
Blessed Sacrament in his hands	inf
 It was there she kept her girlish treasure
trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose
scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to
change when her things came home from the wash and there were some
beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in
Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if
she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so
deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening
round the potherbs	inf

But it must end, she felt	259233379.52868158
 She would
make the great sacrifice	29913557.44755681
 Her every effort would be to share his
thoughts	18722132100.54918
 No, no: not that	31905745.950852633
 They would be
just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other
in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess	2.8767717069303513e+29
 Nothing else mattered	17596.96286860891


And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy
holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running	6.169462926653121e+43


—Come on, Gerty, Cissy called	3338607402.1043057
 It’s the bazaar fireworks	159746.40575981917


But Gerty was adamant	233206.54827978712
 If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she
could see from where she was	5.8441224361060945e+20
 The eyes that were fastened upon her set
her pulses tingling	4888297859149.809
 She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,
and a light broke in upon her	8.107968349618564e+19
 At last they were
left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he
could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of
inflexible honour to his fingertips	1.559984659738079e+42
 His hands and face were working
and a tremour went over her	51356275448152.77
 But this was altogether different from a thing
like that because there was all the difference because she could almost
feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his
handsome lips	2.4851022820405405e+39
 Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do
the other thing before being married and there ought to be women
priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy
Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes
so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’
photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on
the way it did	inf


And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned
back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent
and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was
and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something
queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark	1.0344271914157079e+76
 And
she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in
the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went
higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up
after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused
with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see
her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the
skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,
on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and
then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was
trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full
view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or
wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that
immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the
wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so

 She
would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms
to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a
young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry
that has rung through the ages	1.1314597007726813e+59
 Leopold Bloom (for it is

Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to
show what a great person she was: and then she cried:

—Gerty! Gerty! We’re going	3.0028500476338033e+34
 Come on	1685.6150565309824
 Was it goodbye? No	2106430.502174625
 She drew herself up to her full height	1879878234.9863298


Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,
to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman	1.2333295911811919e+28
 She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic
of her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell
was	7.183702283208842e+21
	13.951045332398436


Tight boots? No	162468.7221861006
 She’s lame! O!

Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away	336317429224779.2
 Poor girl! That’s why she’s
left on the shelf and the others did a sprint	9.439341385238459e+17

 Yours for the asking	183022.65524619934
 Their natural craving	19311.811720577345
 Shoals of them every evening poured
out of offices	27756072237.366165
 Reserve better	1250.3144841983672
 Don’t want it they throw it at you	2539730116.711423

 Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake? _Lingerie_
does it	1.0679037653496723e+19
 I’m all clean come and dirty me	195899327.15965816
 And they like dressing
one another for the sacrifice	42787446858.54786
 Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and
turnedup trousers	5645056104699933.0
 His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what? of jet	2416610994759.3594

Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then	3041658749558.3735
 Out on spec probably	229789.484504391
 And the others inclined to
give her an odd dig	366430036705.14185
 Girl friends at school, arms round each other’s
necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about

 Besides they say if the flower withers she
wears she’s a flirt	46122925057138.78
 Daresay she felt I	162442.47152080963
 Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs	29974564593.779392
 Same time might prefer a tie undone or

 To aid

 Ought to attend to my appearance my age	2737153306.7598915
 Why not? All a prejudice	32520629.182677872
 What? I think so	2125373.287383076
 Wrangle
with Molly it was put me off	3346477931.8668556
 No, I remember	231031.27625887448

 _Lacaus esant
taratara_	5491105.52870188
 Suppose I spoke to her	2015841.999183834
 What about? Bad plan however if you
don’t know how to end the conversation	6.8088226098290904e+16
 Ask them a question they ask
you another	2133030894.7766387
 Good idea if you’re stuck	1371368.9557941917
 Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she’s
on for it: good evening	7.939263337777531e+21
 O but the dark evening in the Appian way I
nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was	1.0198096164719667e+21
 Whew! Girl in Meath
street that night	4278912574.479235
 All the dirty things I made her say	2563363305.3267784
 All wrong of

 The
propitious moment	25359.611167691666
 Something inside them goes pop	1275952.435598689
 Mushy like, tell by
their eye, on the sly	9147654225941.479
 Remember that till
their dying day	16858135.276390117
 Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the
Moorish wall beside the gardens	3999993536235800.0
 But her breasts
were developed	1454485.9806245174
 After Glencree dinner that was when
we drove home	17063208580.625336
 Gnashing her teeth in sleep	2388075.5439346577


There she is with them down there for the fireworks	367060949808.3395
 My fireworks	1375.617039818644
 Dressing in
mother’s clothes	138069.83161565202
 Time enough, understand all the ways of the world	387414554319.4857

And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth	81136224894209.9
 Caressing the little boy too	1776444.094831193
 Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls	210790085686.39337

Fine eyes she had, clear	20713405.477027733
 Like a cat sitting
beyond a dog’s jump	2511363240.0584636
 Call
that innocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her	3.063564031270555e+17
 When I said to Molly the man at
the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like,
twigged at once he had a false arm	3.735469633577778e+31
 Where do they get that?
Typist going up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her
understandings	1.0628181853025302e+22
 Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the
mirror to save the ironing	618769685059584.2
 Attract men, small thing like that	201825231.11329144
 Holding up her hand,
shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red	6.72418215729543e+19
 Me have a nice pace	1871339.5290839258
 Devil you are	16365.682719050496

 Zrads
and zrads, zrads, zrads	1097027316.5897148
 Will she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round	2653713926440.8916


Lord!

Did me good all the same	2667557263.259842
 Lord! It was all things
combined	302678713.9587163
 When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of
my tongue	7432518379048380.0
 Instead of talking about nothing	1597917.2091752903
 Still it was a kind of language between us	27717060315.512558
 It
couldn’t be? No, Gerty they called her	342011251306.388


     Her maiden name was Jemina Brown
     And she lived with her mother in Irishtown	5992350442663434.0


Place made me think of that I suppose	2426910155.568955
 All tarred with the same brush	29327486.995942514

Wiping pens in their stockings	2114318.803344297
 But the ball rolled down to her as if
it understood	3026084940690.208
 Every bullet has its billet	2819824.2452808497
 Saves them	2062.165743257533

Children’s hands always round them	2120702.990830247
 Must call to the hospital	2084077.9658420682
 Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City
Arms	443027271541517.8

Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose	419604168466276.75
 Chickens come home to roost	3305772.2984352885
 It’s the blood of the south	27424960.374335963
 Moorish	126.22576324398437
 Also the form, the
figure	30440870.76981559
 Hands felt for the opulent	1846111.3251000636
 Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard	393284216571.61096
 Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript,
wouldn’t know what to call her	7.589522975748695e+18
 Still there’s destiny in it, falling in love	27048563885.8076
 Twice nought makes one	135075.4176255589
 This wet is very unpleasant	1558720.1226167744


Ow!

Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket	1062299076078839.0
 Long and the
short of it	31850294.266162187
 Big he and little she	2332536.0090776174
 Wonder is there any magnetic
influence between the person because that was about the time he	6.386736620743068e+17
 Cat’s away, the mice will play	484739320.0281614

Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled	1667121720.8022113

And time, well that’s the time the movement takes	402520651859.2835
 Then if one thing
stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit	316164125542509.3
 When you hold out the fork	22306791.170025777
 Come	146.54340648695057
 Shame all put on before third
person	156263496.95872325
 Molly, her underjaw
stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at
the horse show	2.3351596623643235e+24
 Fine
voice that fellow had	1765924.8677831255
 How Giuglini began	19729.453628782943
 Smell that I did	187949.7164488702
 Violets	128.39171052472875
 Came from the turpentine probably in the
paint	3960079778.0379467
 Keep that thing up for hours	19012779.523754124


Wait	139.5845861037148
 Hm	130.06402777692855
 That’s her perfume	15042.042637951994
 I leave
you this to think of me when I’m far away on the pillow	4.5309905700099384e+16
 Roses, I think	196782.42434853347
 Sweet and cheap: soon sour	16029681.568492876
 Why Molly likes opoponax	179013.98676598998
 Suits her,
with a little jessamine mixed	3379474233.0698395
 Heat brought it out	162483.943400669
 Good
conductor, is it? Or bad? Light too	3307823741657.301
 Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself,
slow but sure	4.195954031786245e+20
 Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown
across	1933398036141.832
 Clings to everything
she takes off	24740169.541010994
 Warm shoe	1259.4849906714455
 Know her smell in a thousand	21685949.112090074
 Bathwater too	2047.4028037763096
 There
or the armpits or under the neck	2748196099.853139
 One grain pour off odour for years	214843482.76823467
 Good evening	1413.7560042387672
 Yes now, look at it that
way	3100318850.18602
 We’re the same	17542.133514651854

Like what? Potted herrings gone stale or	1513058160.035994
 Breath? What you eat and drink
gives that	25564111651.578335
 No	152.29096525086916
 Mansmell, I mean	293674.5936007453
 Women buzz round it like
flies round treacle	2076991961.018755
 Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost	4066949290506.5283
 The

 Let me	1568.6899445605611


Mr Bloom inserted his nose	2695006.997187937
 Hm	130.06402777692855
 No	152.29096525086916
 Ah no, that’s the soap	25620079.694635194
 Never
went back and the soap not paid	2388419757.4973536
 I could
mention Meagher’s just to remind him	2628818009.7551847
 How much do
I owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir	4.874007815833303e+17
 Lose your customers that way	2265943.627470225
 Just went as
far as turn back	175642604.6470115
 Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government
sit	1887372693775.5864

Still you learn something	158991.98119955545
 Ask yourself
who is he now	19850167.474530645
 And that
fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh	5641151141312.135
 Corns on his

 I begin to like them at that age	2464869273.4538817
 Suppose it’s the only time we cross
legs, seated	231623542501.17212
 But it’s the evening influence	1902411.8013005971
 They feel all that	193307.0060394912

 All that old hill has seen	17611801.774432596
 Lovers: yum yum	283549.3204503491
 Will I get up? O wait	230651592.60772374
 Drained all the manhood out of

 Only once it

 Take the train there tomorrow	1735381.8990177333
 Like kids your second visit to a house	2989628598.2000217
 Nothing

 Curious she an only child, I

 Certainly in every public work
which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with
importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted
(whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it
is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent
inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest)
whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that
whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly

 Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered
what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he,

 And he was ware
and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was
older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights
virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke
to him full gently	5.963231148381902e+53

 There was a sort of scholars along either side
the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary
Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of
medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa,
one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at
head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long
of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young
Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and
beside the meek sir Leopold	inf
 And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast
friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that
his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as
they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner	3.207425119264624e+47

 This was
scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother,

following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk	8.991573946547694e+20
 But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we
nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very
God, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief	7.774512066137455e+46

Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that
beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the

did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his
engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to
do	1.1316574901939348e+72
 Then spake young Stephen orgulous of
mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,
of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of
brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius
saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or
an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu
secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of
Averroes and Moses Maimonides	inf
 All they bachelors then
asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as
risk life to save life	5.862899843201567e+24
 A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted
all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that
as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a
layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an
accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had
birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their
questions	inf


But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had
pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and
as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only
manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art
could save so dark is destiny	3.9167012747935184e+65
 And she was wondrous stricken of heart
for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of
lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and
lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir
Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him
his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness
and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for
all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure
for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and
murdered his goods with whores	inf

habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her
hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of

thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou

To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in
Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he
had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the
womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days	8.585007976208854e+57

said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was
the eternal son and ever virgin	8.533780977354268e+22

But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words? No, for he
had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be
done away	4.572506277223784e+32
 And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the
other? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either	1.5266024684944069e+30

that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one
day die as he was like the rest too a passing show	3.820795869262985e+35

he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the
land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for
ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering
at which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told
him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason
was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing
exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him
wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as,
Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave
place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot

So Thursday sixteenth June Patk	1532200.7405010553
 Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and
after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a
fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields
athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too	2.697546733659637e+54
 In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through
Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was
before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no
more crack after that first	1.0193242982948116e+47
 Bannon in a cut bob (which are
now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from
Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M’s brother will stay a
month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there,
he bound home and he to Andrew Horne’s being stayed for to crush a cup
of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of
her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and

Leop	193.68270965874825


With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the
letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about
him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but
on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit
near by which he did mighty brisk	1.3274904840968898e+72
 To tell the truth he
was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the
coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men,
runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues
of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at
nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much
loose gossip	1.457714353624692e+78
 There’s as good fish
in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take
of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the
meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his
embassy as he was sharpset	2.559773814082675e+55
 From a
child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough,
who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of
the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but
he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar
with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes	1.8129025793669838e+74
 And he had experience of the like brood
beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been
some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster
that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr
Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street	9.040838641078828e+55
 I question with you there, says he	3705351989.3548746
 Mr Stephen, a little
moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had
dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the
hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted
cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the
bull by the horns	5.383920107358253e+62
 I
conceive you, says Mr Dixon	381472760.6567756

What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas
that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who
were no better off than himself	1.965065038104122e+37
 But the slap and
the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he
taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess
and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the
month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the
nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young
ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland	inf
 Ay, says another,
and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the
land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his
mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the
island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the
grass that grows on the ground	3.0968671845575664e+78
 I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with
the help of that good pizzle my father left me	1.1244907296935499e+23
 Then, with the
water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had
belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language
to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first
personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if
ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write
it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or
a bale of cotton or a corkfloat	inf
 In short, he and the bull of Ireland
were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt	6.492840976060035e+21


A man’s a man for a’ that	3653666402.453833
 Mr Mulligan was civil
enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a
project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched
on	3.332145970559016e+37
 Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards
which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend
printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan	3.6700158953118965e+36
 Fertiliser and
Incubator	32939.73909624623
 Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon	6.293080312356772e+16
 ’Tis as
cheap sitting as standing	134370580.87874633
 To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a
suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of
worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in
fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord
Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our
ascendancy party	4.578704794421615e+70
 He proposed to set up there a national fertilising
farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the
fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the
fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there
direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her
natural	1.0014948507806485e+67
 Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for
his pains	6.155049889493537e+18
 For his
nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet
of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these
latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both
broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum
chillies	4.5074914792145376e+58
 After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of
asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief
with which he had shielded it	3.836042434098686e+31
 They both, it seems, had been overtaken
by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as
might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which
was now somewhat piebald	1.0148610879026602e+43
 His project meanwhile was very favourably
entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr
Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he
purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle	3.1480073821900006e+42
 Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for
whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him
a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional
assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very
heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he
was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was
in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he
fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place	inf
 Mr
Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether
his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an
ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,
as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the
stomach	1.9735764287296846e+63
 But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in
my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept
of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give
thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver
of good things	6.686682135963986e+66
 God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!
Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her
favours	1.6456429390781295e+30
 But indeed, sir, I wander from the point	383346028263.8019
 Maledicity! he exclaimed in
anguish	37976588.72175504
 Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my
cloak along! I could weep to think of it	1.217224678562265e+24
 Tut, tut! cries Le
Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most
accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in
a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape
Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even
the stoutest cloak	4.859865274409144e+75

posthaste to another world	1.050648994549002e+32

pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my

the first is a bath	3.7145638915922613e+46
 What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad’s bud, immensely so,
said Mr Lynch	3.311392679977469e+23
 The young
surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as
the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward	5.2624551027775444e+32

Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings
of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable
fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy	1.6406178559700579e+40
 I
am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of
witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far
from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human
breast	1.648660387032226e+45
 I cannot away with them	1798987.3262186507
 Having
delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and
repaired to the door	1.0720699594121367e+20
 Stap my vitals, said he, them was
always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most
particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand
to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks
back on with a loving heart	1.5275849411410076e+59

The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as
overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were
difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and
outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were
they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of
strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf	1.7245680702631013e+70
 But the word of Mr
Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch
that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born
out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into
the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent
indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of
creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin	inf


Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express
his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to
express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid
genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her
confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers	2.4835012292953518e+73

The dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that
expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian
matron	1.9499030171857105e+30
 I cannot but extol
the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another
child out of her	2.206721290091404e+22
 Singular, communed the guest with himself, the
wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that
the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the
seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic
titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of
levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise
eminent have esteemed the noblest	2.2037236154518477e+75
 But, he further added, it is mayhap
to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have
more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together	7.538779984894943e+35


But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,
has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted
to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal
polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have
counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary
advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that
moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a
tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per
cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is
it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own
dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady,
the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant
reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it
was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so	inf

the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the
afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic
affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous
exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and
solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would
palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and
obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of
tongues	inf
 In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring
to urge, to mollify, to refrain	3.444409384065386e+21

display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union
among tempers so divergent	5.183221110603781e+24
 Every phase of the situation was
successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers,
the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that
rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as
the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr
Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused,
the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and
triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the
acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the
agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan)
in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the
medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other
spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation
of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the
vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in
the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix,
artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb
consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the
species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that
distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers
_Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and
monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of
consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which
Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic
illustrations	inf
 The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine
were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the
state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step
over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should
strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a
yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand
against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the
seat of castigation	inf
 The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole,
supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain
